Subject FW Possible new Etag time table


Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in ETag

What he is proposing is
	a revision to the timeline tables in AA to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or realtime
currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag
	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Areas prevailing time
this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and its the Authority Service that keeps the time

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the  release

Process
Please review his proposal and comment
Specifically do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS  If there is
support from all of ISAS then it can be taken to NERC ISTISWG for
approval

Please let me know by the end of business June

  tag time table draft june doc
 Bob

 Mark Hackney suggested I start with you on this issue since you were
 heading up the timing group for ISAS

 Here is the issue  under the current WSCC timing table for tags in Policy
  it is impossible to program whether or not the tag is preschedule or
 realtime  The NERC tagging group is the group that came up with manually
 selecting the preschedule flag  I know that PPW BPA and ourselves have
 run into a couple of problems with this  Its been when the merchant has
 selected that flag when it was actually a realtime transaction  PPW and
 ourselves put it in our scheduling system BPA and someone else did not


 At the NERC OSC meeting last week I asked the question again about how
 can this be fixed in version   I was hoping it was as easy as having
 each authority register their timezone in the new Master registry thats
 being developed  Well  it wasnt that easy  They explained the other
 problems and I then developed the attached time table  The group reviewed
 this time table and agreed that it could be automated to determine if a
 tag was preschedule or realtime

 In order to get this programmed into version  we need to get Policy 
 revised with the new time table  In order to get the new time table
 approved it probably starts with your subgroup then probably goes to
 Hackney for an email vote to ISAS then probably on to WSCC OC then
 finally to NERC  Problem is we need to do this quickly by the end of
 June if possible so that the new Policy  will be out in time for 
 release in October

 Now  theres nothing that says this has to happen either  Another option
 is to just leave it as it is today  Id prefer to automate it but thats
 only my opinion

 At any rate  the NERC OSC has agreed to include timezone in the new NERC
 Master registry  They have also agreed to incorporate this change into
  if its part of Policy   Thats were we stand right now

 As for your subgroup  I dont think Im on your list but go ahead and
 add me on if you dont mind

 Call or email if you have any questions

 Thanks  Jerry

 Bob
Sorry for the late response Ive been gone the last  days I will not be
able to make the meeting on June  I do like Jack Dempseys proposal Im
not sure I completely understand Mons reasoning but I believe the PSE
submission deadline should be left at  minutes for the following 
reasons

 A is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and
excluding the ramp time If we change it to read  minutes prior
    to start that would allow a tag to be submitted at  after

 If the  minutes verbage is to be used then the the remaining verbage
defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will
    need to be removed

It was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the realtime
deadline at  after

However I still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to
the new BPs being put forth by the ESCESTF Are we going to take into
account the BPs that the ECSESTF have put outbeing commented on The
schedule process BP has several rampingtiming changes as well as frag
tags They arent asking whether or not we should adopt Eastern Connection
timelines theyre just doing it

Personally I dont think the majority of the WSCCs units can handle a 
minute ramp and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude
to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts
However that is being proposed

I would appreciate someone elses opinion on where the proposed BPs fit in
with our goal

 cell	Has anyone or everyone read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by NERC on Tuesday It is ESCs Scheduling and Approval
Practices submitted by the Multiple Task Groups  Scheduling Process
Approval Schedule Timing Granularity and Ramping Task Groups
	Specifically they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
minute straddle ramp  to  In addition theyre recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter as already exists at  
 with a  minute ramp Their reasoning is and this is a quote large
generators that require longer Ramp times eg  or  minutes could
partially ramp for  minutes across the schedule start then finish with
another minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp
This would accommodate areas such as Florida and WSCC where longer ramp
times are needed
	Their asking for feedback for the public posting This proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations Anyone have any comments Im
attaching a copy of the document Its  pages long about  of them on
frag tags The ramping stuff and recommendations are the last couple of

Subject	Wednesday ENPOWER CLEANUP meeting 

Dear traders

Just a reminder that we will be having our weekly EnPower Cleanup meeting this Wednesday April    
It should take no longer than  minutes

Please contact me with any questions you may have in the mean time

Virginia



Dear Bill

Below please find a voice recording of a tape that I have pulled  I think this is a good example of a clear recap which comes in handy and leaves no question as to price volume or time

Thanks

Virginia


 Dear Traders

Here are a couple of things Ive thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute  Please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research 

 All notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them  Notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders interpretation

 Can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times  I often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason  

 One thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the Inc sheets however I still sometimes find that the traders notes and the Inc sheets or the El Paso Model dont match  At that point I dont know which one to go by  I need to be sure that I can trust the accuracy of the Inc sheets as the endall

 Please make sure that all realtime deals or realtime extended deals are getting routed  Ive come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate  It also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes

 Please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled  Ive seen a few deals that are in the traders notebooks but that havent been entered in EnPower  You know the result

 CUTS need I say more are a mess  I really really need to see notes on every cut  This means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database AND notes in deal scheduling  
When a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut I need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note  Many of my DMSs could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in EnPower this means I found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in EnPower  I specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule  Where did resupply come from deal  too  Was it a bookout deal  too  Whats the resupply price  Who at the counterparty did our trader talk to  What is the reason for the cut  And please initial your notes so that if I have a question about them I know who to ask
You can never make too many notes

One thing to remember is that Deal Entry Deal Scheduling and Lotus Notes do not communicate with each other so though it is a grueling task every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least  places  its called copy and paste

If we can keep these things in mind I think we will have fewer disputes in the future  And when we do have disputes Ill be able to figure them out in a more timely manner  

Thanks for your attention to these things  I look forward to bugging you less in the future

PLEASE SEE PAUL CHOI OR ME IF YOU ARE AVAILABLEDear RealTimers

We are having the same problem with Montana Powers checkout as we had last month the volume of disputes is overwhelming

I have looked at the Inc sheets and found that EnPower matches the Inc sheets
But in fairness to MPCs disputes last month when I trusted the Inc sheets and I pulled the tapes I found that our Inc sheets were wrong in a number of places

Mike and I are doing the March  checkout and are having trouble finding your logs your notebooks or any information regarding the dates in question

I am listing below the dates and HE that we are having disputes for  Please look at your logs and let me know the MW value price and who you spoke to at MPC at what time  Please do not give me what the Inc sheets say as Mike and I have already looked at them

I expect an answer from each of you ASAP

This sheet is as complete as possible and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances

  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was  MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today

  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between  and  from  mw long to flat I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO who  
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners but that booked out and did not seem to match the  long that I saw in the dispatch sheet  I spoke with Pete who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer  

  I still was unable to resolve the  mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at  pm  I was very uncomfortable doing this and so in my desperation called Roger at home who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat  flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July   I trust his assesment and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron we have spent over  hours dealing with the EPE schedules today  

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for

There is a  mw light load schedule that Aquila Canada is generating and AVA sinks at there system   The schedule is going realtime because Aquila reported the transmission incorrectly to BPA transmission group  We bought from Aquila Deal   and sold to WWP Deal    Please refer to Aquila tag numbers  and   Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out  

Thanks

 WHEN THEY ARE MAKING TAGS THEY ARE IDAC

When we tag them and they are sinking they are still IPCM
We are  MW long all hours at Montana System  which is our buy from MPC deal number 

The upstream is PSEIDUKEWWPMPCO

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule and that tag is 

When we get close to HE  on Monday that Tag needs to go away and the energy needs to be sold

Please dont say it was a false preschedule just say that it was unexpectedly ramped down or something

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

CaraThe following day ahead tag  for the th was denied by WACM because it was submitted after the pdt tag deadline  Tag  was the predecessor and was approved by WACM  Still WACM refuses to approve TAG  Please copy this tag and submit it as a realtime schedule on the th  Sorry for the inconvenience I received ZERO cooperation from the control areas   Please check out with each control area when submitting the new tag  Per Mary at WACM I could not tag this schedule day ahead  

Thanks

SubjectLoss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area WACM has just implemented
 a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a 
reminder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be complete
d

  Please ensure that WACM is the last PSE on the tag  This is importan
t as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli
vered
  In the Comments field please put the words WACM Losses  If the ta
gs are for a realtime transaction from the previous week please indicate 
the date ie WACM Losses for MMDDYY
  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t
o WACM
  Realtime transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish
ed same day next week same profile
  It is allowable to combine losses due in any dayweekmonthseason on a
 single tag if that is easier for you to do so  WACM calculates the amount
 of loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu
led transaction losses due on Day  plus realtime transaction losses due 
from day 

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if with the new schedulin
g software implemented we will be able to accept realtime transaction los
s energy concurrent with the realtime transaction  If we are able to effe
ct that change it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an email off to
 you immediately

In the meantime if you have any questions please give me a call or send a
n email

 Preschedule had a heckuva day on Friday  Due to many problems some of our tags were not completed until after the pm preschedule deadline  Apparently some of our counterparties automatically deny late tags though they may be corrections of tags made prior to the deadline  In any case we have a list of tags that have been submitted as realtime tags and the schedules should be treated such  The tags and paths are as follows

Im going home for the weekend and I thought I would let you know the
procedure to follow to get your schedules at MEAD scheduled real time

These are the schedules that are in as a preschedule
	TAG   
	TAG   
	MSCGO TAG MSCI

The left over mws after these tags  will all have to be submitted as a
realtime tag NO EARLIER THAN  HOURS BEFORE THE SCHEDULE RUNS

You will have to call PSCO marketing realtime desk to tell them what you new
tags will be    They have a heads up from me as to what you
will call about  If you do not call  THEY WILL NOT PUT THE SCHEDULE IN WE
WILL NOT GENERATE

I understand EPMIs problem today  Ive been there when I worked for MIECO
Our control area that we turn all our schedules into are kind of hard to
work with sometimes  It is up to them weather or not a schedule gets put in
as a preschedule  Before they go home every night they must check out
preschedules with their adjacent control areas  Since they work on an
hourly basis and dont get bonuses  they are not always willing to stick
around and wait on late tags  Between pm and pm MDT they take the
tags they have and start to check out with them  Everything else must be
put in real time  This sometimes makes our jobs harder but there is nothing
I can do about it  I hope everything else goes well and these schedules get
put in

														STCA buys  MW  sp for  deal number 

Kysa M Alport
Enron North America
After consulting with our California Scheduling team to determine why  volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours I have revised my sheet and I think youll find this new one more fitting

 		
Also the  sheet has been revised slightly  namely the NP transmission column Daniel per our conversation this morning the NP and SP on peak prices happened to be the same on this day so they are correct as you see them in the sheet

Please call me with questions

Thanks
Kate

														Daniel  Judy 
	Please note  I have adjusted  to reflect the load EES reported to EPMI for that day I just received your sheet from Michael Spruiell today and didnt have a chance to go over the revised spreadsheet with Phil Platter before he left This may need some more tweaking but please let me know if were getting closer to solving the mystery of May st

Thanks

We are missing an IDS from STWBOM to STCALI for Saturday  We sold  mws to STCALI at   This should be the same as Fridays deal   We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Fridays onpeak deal carry over into Saturday

If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time

Thanks for the help

I dont usually send out a group email but listen to this shit  So I am s
itting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks lo
ose  It is about am and most of the trading has subsided for the morni
ng  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that a
re serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food w
ill lasttoday is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast f
rom a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used t
o because no one wants to get up at am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enro
n employees they usually cook it the night before So everyone on the flo
or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b
reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would
 wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs  So I grab the first 
omelet and the crowd surges toward the two  yearold women at the grill 
 Everyone is smiling deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w
ill get crazy and add salsa or something  The next thing you know straigh
t out of a FOX tv show or Youve Gotta See This episodethis old woman 
is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago  The propane tanks he
ating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide raising up to te
n feet in height  The place turns into a frenzy Nobody can move react o
r anything  Everyone is frozen watching this old womanpicture happy Gilmo
res grandma go up like an old Christmas tree  A few seconds before this 
high school chemistry experiment I was sitting on the first row right in t
he middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and
 glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN on the inch Liquid FlatScreen TV 
that is directly above my desk The old woman that went into flames is dire
ctly in front of me about a literal three feet away and I am directly faci
ng the inferno along with a coworker who is catching the blunt of the heat
 of the flames I dont save the old woman like most of you might have thou
ght I cant do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is g
oing to jump in there and save this poor lady  The old woman is yelling 
Somebody get me outta hereyet we all continue to starefinally so
meone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze  Who is this masked man
 I have no clue  However I do witness Les from middle marketing doing hi
s best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the
 only one in the office that has a clue where it is I see someone throwing
 a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier which is funny if not for the 
fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to
 blister up  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on th
e old woman ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me and torc
hing a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens  The alarm in o
ur building  World Trade Center is screaming and the smoke is enough to m
ake even Polarek leave the area  So the fire departemnt comes and the old
 woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital  Who know
s what condition she is in but all I know is I hope I am never around a bu
nch of vaginasmyself and the rest of us that did nothing when I go up in 
flames someday  Well I have to get back to work because I have wasted abo
ut  minutes writing this drama  Take care Scotty

 As you know Settlements already captured the  in a  I believe Settlements didnt capture b and c because the deals were entered after the deals liquidated in the same month  Risk can do a manual adjustment for you on this  credit net of  and  right away and then well take  in a as pma this monthend since we didnt take it on

KateWith the departure of Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs it is necessary to reestablish responsibilities to assure our continued success  To this end

Chris Foster will assume responsibility for the Services Desk in addition to retaining overall responsibility for the Middle Market Coverage Group  Although he will continue to provide leadership to John Paul and Stewart in managing the Middle Market Coverage effort Chris will focus his daytoday efforts on our Services business  

John Malowney Paul Choi and Stewart Rosman will be taking a greater leadership role within the Coverage Group  Within this coverage group John Malowney will assume a leadership role for Industrials throughout the WSCC Stewart Rosman will assume responsibility for public utilities IOUs and publicfederal utilities in the Northwest and Northern California and Paul Choi will cover these same sectors in the Southwest and Southern California  Although each of these individuals will take the lead in assuring coverage for their market segment it will be done on a collaborative basis to take advantage of individual relationships and talents and to make sure there is backup if someone is out of the office  Additional personnel will be hired in the Middle Market Coverage Group within the next month  Job postings will be made shortly

Bill Williams will continue to manage the Real Time Group and will now report to Tim Belden

Lisa Gang will move into the Services Group to help manage our scheduling agreement with El Paso and provide support for other services arrangements  This will be effective September   Lisa Gang Les Rawson and Stan Cocke will report to Chris Foster and endeavor to expand our already successful Services business
 
While we will miss Holli and Greg personally I have complete confidence that the new energy and fresh ideas that their departure brings will assure our market leader position will not compromised

Could you take a look at what Ive put together Conceivably this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we or I could maintain which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management Thats a whole different subject  maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment At any rate this is a rough draft but I thought Id show it to you to make sure Im heading in the right direction

KateJim  Darren 

It looks as though the only ISO trueup information Risk received was regarding our July variance of  This does not take into account the August variances totalling approx  in revenue we did not receive throughout the month Fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the Short Term West Hourly book but as you can see by the attached email Risk has only accounted for July variances not August in this PMA 

I did go over the Month End Variance report Jim gave me and I have some questions about the totals listed in it  in particular having to do with charges    and  Let me know when one or both of you has a moment and I think we can clear this up

Again I think the only variances we still have out there for the WHOURLY book are the four that occurred in August which are as follows

  
  
  	
  

As long as were all aware of the ISO charges and revenue still unaccounted for  and know they will be in the future  I think we can all sleep soundly Let me know if you have any questions on this

Subject	iso revenueexpenses true up for August 

Kate

Per your request I have double checked Risks daily record on ISO revenueexpenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out  Here is the result

Daily ISO revenueexpenses total 	 you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your PL 
July ISO true up					 
					total	
Monthend August ISO revenueexpenses 	 we got this total from Volume Mgmt
Variance ie trueup				

I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results  Jim advised that they might have added some items after fact during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the monthend flash and thats probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you

Please let me know if you have any questions

Just wanted to let you know that as of HE on August rd we will no longer be the Scheduling Coordinator for Delano Energy  AES bought them out so they will be doing their SC services for them

Thanks

Please make a note of the following I know we have several new traders and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job Thanks

 Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book Pay attention when extending deals If you dont purchase the energy in a particular book you dont have energy to sell from that book

 Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso Also pay attention to detail with EPE spinning reserves as a violation is extremely expensive for EPE also curtail units in the right order Copper then Newman  then Four Corners Be sure to curtail Four Corners before selling under cost

 El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done Check spreadsheet formulas Print a copy of the model and attach it to the CARP before filing

 El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model melectricepeepeaugepe reconciliation model and all variances explained

 Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a  FLAT broker fee per trade If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades enter a permegawatt fee and extend the deal later with bilateral trades youre effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL 

 Most importantly if you are not sure call someone who is

Thanks again for your attention to these matters

I think this is the market notice you two were refering to  Yes CAISO  will use the lower of SCsubmitted bids or a units proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the MCP of supplemental energy and AS However my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and AS  If you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your units proxy costs and are willing to justify them you should bid your higherthanproxy costs If you are accepted you are supposed to be paid as bid

Let me know if you want me to follow up with CAISO or let me know if you have asked them about this


 Well be short  mw at Palo Verde under the STWBOM book for Monday also  short under STSW Buy to cover this real time Sell back to EPE   Enter buys and sales under the same desk either STWBOM or STSW Here are the deals

  STWBOM buys EPE
	 On PeakPV
	  MW

  STWBOM sells STSW
	 On PeakPV	
	  MW

  STSW buys EPE
	 On PeakPV

I wanted to give everyone a status report on FSP before I headout on vacation  In a nutshell its not quite there  We are now meeting performance targets but we had a few too many bugs to allow users to complete the parallel intime  I will begin paying my dollar a day debt starting on Saturday but I feel fairly confident that we should wrap things up next week  Susan Amador will be working in Portland next week in my absence to ensure realtime can finish up their part

Thanks  David Poston

Here are the details for the remaining  days of the parallel
DA preferreds  finals are complete for   
DA preferreds are  complete for     Waiting on STCALI to input the last few schedules

Performance figures
Template writing     target  minutes
Finals processing   minutes target  minutes

Bugs
 remaining critical bug on exercises for supplement schedules should be finished tomorrow

Preliminary Schedule contingent on no new critical bugs found by realtime
  Wrapup HA parallel first part of next week
  Migrate code to production end of next week
  Begin production parallel  As suggested by Phil Platter we will continue using the existing toolset but we will write DA preferred templates out of FSP at the same time  Then we can execute some compare utilities we have developed to ensure the ISO templates between CAPS  FSP match perfectly
  We will run in this mode until the users feel good about FSP


 Only  will buy you your choice of date for Susies Babys Birthday

This is an email I sent to our generators regarding decing and buyback strategies  Please read so you know whats going and can take the lead on implementing these strategies  Well let you know when all the generators on board

Thanks
Stan




Due to the relatively weak realtime market during morning hours we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buyingback generation that youve sold forward  We want to stress that this is a relatively shortterm strategy  As the weather turns cold during the lateAutumn and Winter months the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the realtime market

Lately HE have been very weak realtime ranging between  and   We have two strategies that we would like to suggest

  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate  Basically we would be letting the ISO know that were willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mws from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity  You are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it from the ISO  For example if your cost to generate is  and you sell dayahead for  you make MWh  If the ISO takes the decremental bid and the price is  then you make MWh   

Advantages  A relatively large upside the price the ISO charges could actually go negative as large as negative   Also you would actually be buying from the ISO as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk

Disadvantages  Ten minute dispatch  When we submit decremental bids the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every  minutes  In addition to the physical problems this might create the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow

  BuyingBack Blocks in the BiLateral Market
This strategy calls for our realtime traders to buy blocks of energy in the bilateral market for below your cost to generate  This would call for you to reduce your generation and the energy we buyback in the realtime market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity  Once again you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it at the price paid to buyback the energy   As in the previous example if your cost to generate is  and you sell dayahead for  you make MWh  If we can buyback the energy for a price of  then you make MWh   Additionally if we do buyback the energy we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order  Then if the ISO takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit 

Advantages  No  minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced  Also the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage

Disadvantage  Not as large of an upside as decremental bidding

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy  buyingback blocks of energy in the bilateral market  Once you and our realtime traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO  We propose a  profit split above your dayahead profit earned from either of these two strategies

If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster

Enron Canada has encountered several hours in the last few weeks where we have acquired nonfirm transmission hourly from BC Hydro been able to flow ie not been cut and the Portland realtime desk has been unable to find a buyer I realize that the timing of the hourly nonfirm transmission is difficult The financial cost to Enron Canada is C per MWh for every MW we buy from BC and cant flow in excess ot C last night

Are there any players in the Pacific NorthWest who Enron can use as a buyer of last resort Do have any suggestions that may alleviate the no buyer found problems

Harbor Cogen has been prescheduled for Thursday  mw HE  There are a few things that needs to be done in realtime

	We would like to try to buyback the first few hours for something under  what they sold for dayahead  Well use their dayahead price rather than their generation costs because we sold dayahead for slightly below their generation costs of  in order to make money with this buyback strategy and selling mw from the steam turbine in realtime  So please try to buyback HE or through HE if prices warrant mw SP  Treat this like the Delano buyback where we split the profit with the customer  Please stay in contact with the control room to communicate which hour they are supposed to come up for

	We need to sell mw from the steam turbine in realtime  The steam turbine can only be started up  hours after the gas turbine is fired up  On the back end it can shut down the same hour that the gas turbine shuts down  So please sell mw SP beginning  hours after the gas turbine comes on  For example if you bring the gas turbine on beginning HE please begin selling the steam turbine HE through HE

  VIrginiaThe lowerofbid or proxy cost rule only applies during System Emergencies  The rest of the time the ISO uses your bid assuming you have submitted one  This socalled improvement only makes things worse because during System Emergencies you cannot bid above the proxy price because the software will default to proxy prices if your bid exceeds the proxy price

We have checked out with our counterparties according to our numbers but MPC claims they have done their control area checkouts and they stick by their numbers  There is a grey line here because the MWs that we are missing on those  days are actually in favor of the counterparty who we sold to so it may be that they had a discrepancy but did not pipe up
Nonetheless if I adjust our system accordingly meaning put the trades in or increase the  of MWs well have to hear from those counterparties  Im planning on telling them that the control area checkouts have been done and that they need to check their control area numbers  I think Sandy at MPC will be willing to support us if our sale counterparties want proof

Let me know if you have any other thoughts

  As we have been back and forth for  months now there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPCs numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues however there are  discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers I have filled out tape requests for these   Please keep in mind though that we do not have access to these tapesand have not had since April These requests will go to Tim

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the pass thru especially since we have already checked out with them
  Only one dispute a pricing issue could potentially leave us with a negative  DPR

  I need you to make the call today  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done

  If I dont hear from you by tomorrow morning Ill adjust our system according to MPCs numbers until I do

Bottom of Form Hey there Bill

Ok an update and a little explanation  Im sorry I couldnt write you
yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients  But Im writing you now  I
just pray that I wont get too busy today  That probably wont work all
that well since Im here and not at church where I should be  Catholics
are funny about that stuff  Yep  Im the good little Catholic girl  My
moms a first grade Catholic private school teacher my dad used to teach
CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and
confeesion on Saturdays  It doent always work out so well if you know what
I mean  I took a Sunday shift today didnt I

Anyhow the POrtland trip  Let me share with you the dilemma  Ok I set
aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation  That money is
currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral
in LA  Also my family members the son of the one who died was coming up
to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive
restraunts etc  So that probably wont happen  But basically its the
first reason  I dont know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane
ticket plus any other details food funeral flowersgifts etc and still
get to go to Portland
Plus Im moving in a month so Im going to have moving expenses as well
Ughhh  I want to go soooo bad

But things all happen for a reason  It looks like I may not be able to go
but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket


Aprox  hours later

Well I just got off the phone with you so you actually know all about the
about issues above  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you
You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour  WOW

I dont think I can send my picture on this computer  Ill try but it may
not work  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think Im an ogre is
that spelled right  I tell you what Ill send you one if you send me
one  Deal  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the
other person looks like that you are talking to  Then again some people
look better in pictures than in real life  Im not fortunate enough to be
one of those

Geez we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I dont
really have anything to say  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it
because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to
reference this 

Oh well saved by the bella coworker of mine has just bought me lunch
He really is a sweet guy  Im not sure but I think hes a little slow
Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do
the filing and patient transport for me  He is such a nice guy  then today
he knows Im moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in
to bring me lunch  Awwwh  I am going to miss alot of people out here

You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit  Any ideas
when that might be  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you
that oyu have extended to me  If you are in my vicinity you are more than
welcome to stay with me and Ill show you around  Unless of course you are
coming out soon then it would be more like ok we are two lost tourist
I would love to see alot of the LA things  Sunset BLVD Universal Studios
all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area  I hear
they are fabulous  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around Ill be well
versed in the places to be  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the
Wishire Regency Hotel  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet  Complete
with chocolate covered strawberries  Yummm

Oh I am a fanatic about desserts

ScottyAlthough a final order is not yet available we were able to glean the basic content of the Commissions latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagners recommendations which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC  Highlights include

In California refundsoffsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX and only as of October 

Both public and nonpublic utilities are subject to refund

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June  Order as refined by Judge Wagner

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology

A  creditworthiness premium will be added

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have  days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in  days

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of  days followed by an evidentiary proceeding of  days  The Judge would then have an additional  days to report to the Commission  An issue will be the definition of spot transaction for the Pac NW since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues

need  you to send me a check ASAP  My address is  SW Dakota Drive

 games starting on September th

The other issue I need you to ponder is st Division vs nd Division  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship for  years if we are st or nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to st division  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager nay volunteers and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in nd or move up to st  Also send me
money  Thanks

      The  congestion charge on the th that was allocated to the stCA desk has been split between both of your desks though the change will not show up until the month end flash reports  Look for it then but trust me it has been changed  In the future I will ask about HA congestion charges that show up on stCA to make sure they are warranted  Any questions let me know

later

Dukes Calif Whistleblowers Have History Of Grievances  Updated Wednesday June    PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThree former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy DUK investmentsquotessymbolDUK news investmentsnewssymbolDUK msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolDUK ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of  complaints while they were still working at the plant including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination the men told Dow Jones Newswires 
Most of the grievances were filed between  and  against the plants previous owner Sempra Energy SRE investmentsquotessymbolSRE news investmentsnewssymbolSRE msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolSRE unit San Diego Gas  Electric for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Dukes profitcentered management style in the deregulated market 
Duke has called the employees allegations about its operating procedures baseless Duke has said the employees have an ax to grind because they werent hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDGEs workforce 
The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers who are locked in a highstakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives 
Glenn Johnson  a mechanic at the South Bay power plant alone filed  complaints On one occasion Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos He also has a harassment complaint against SDGE regarding an employee who now works for Duke but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it 
Aside from the formal complaints Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for  months for cancer treatment 
This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business he said 
One of the other employees Jim Olkjer  a former assistant control room operator at the power plant filed three complaints against SDGE while Duke operated the plant because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision The grievances were either turned down or settled he said 
Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldnt be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April 
Im on a fixed income now Olkjer said in an interview I cant afford my utility bills on a fixed income 
The third employee Ed Edwards  a certified power plant mechanic said he filed one complaint against three SDGE employees in  for racial discrimination One of the employees was hired by Duke That case is still pending 
Edwards an AfricanAmerican said Duke didnt hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired lessqualified white employees Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDGE were replaced with white employees when Duke took over 
Edwards who stopped working at the plant in February said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson 
I knew I wouldnt be hired he said 
Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDGE with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
SDGE spokesman Art Larson wouldnt comment on the allegations Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and always hires the most qualified employees 
In  Duke settled a  discrimination claim with the US Department of Labor for  in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions 
Dissatisfaction With New Priorities 
The former employees said they werent motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state Johnson first alerted the media about Dukes behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers 
The employees each earned about  a week 
All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down tossing out spare parts and operating machinery when it was broken Olkjer said he saw the plants output reduced during the worst power emergencies at least  times 
When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him Its none of your business 
The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant 
I was paid to twist wrenches Johnson said The last raise I got two years ago was  Thats an insult to my skill 
Duke said it is bringing the former SDGE employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local  The workers were previously represented by another local and Duke wanted a single contract 
Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the companys gluttony and greed He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant 
Johnson Edwards and Olkjer said in the old days the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down But as soon as deregulation became law in the state things started to change SDGE would also vary the plants output but not as dramatically as Duke did they said 
To the best of my recollection we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time Edwards said Once Duke took the reins that changed We were no longer a family 
Duke has said that it adjusted the plants output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator manager of the states power grid 
The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid and the employees who testified werent in a position to know the whole picture said Bill Hall vice president of Dukes western operations 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan  the period cited from the controlroom logs to keep supply in balance A copy of the ISO controlroom logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders during a Stage  emergency because it didnt need Dukes capacity which it thought too expensive

	Tonight we are having the large TV removed from the SE Corner of the floor and the one in the SW corner moved out of the walkway space  

The removal of the large screen is due to how low it hangs and the hazard it presents to people walking in the area  Since we do not use that screen and we do not have a good place to put it we will store it until a suitable use is identified 

The smaller screen will be move North and East about  feet to get it out of the walkway

Subject	Generator Checkouts and Control Area Services
Importance	High

Group

I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enrons ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers  I believe that we can provide Warrens group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading

Therefore 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated not an estimate  Finally sign off the hour in the services book  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a scheduleplease call Les or me

If this process takes more than  minutes please let me know It is each traders responsibilty to make this work  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered  And yes we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function

Thanks

Because Lotus will probably go away when the new Enpower system comes online  and Mike brought up a good point about not being able to mine information from the current emails that we do  we need to think of a way to have a data repository like the West Power discussion

I am thinking a webbased format kind of like a news group but would like to talk to you

C
At Enron were good at a lot of things  making markets commoditizing products managing risk offering innovative energy solutions to customers  the list goes on and on  However one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses  Were all shareholders in this company and we need to spend our companys dollars as wisely as we spend our own

There are some simple yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure were careful with Enrons money  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following

	Professional Services  This is our largest area of discretionary spending at more than  million last year Professional Services includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms contractors and other consulting groups  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing GSS effective July   In addition contracts for more than  must be preapproved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS  For more information see httpibuyitenroncom

	Online expense reporting tool XMS  XMS our online expense reporting tool enables us to expedite monitor and report expenses  Effective July  all employees on domestic US payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of businessrelated expenses To access XMS go to httpxmsenroncom  

	Enterprise wide portal  We currently have  internal web sites across the company  The amount of technology work marketing collateral and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online  This new companywide portal under the leadership of Tony Mends will be launched in several phases beginning this fall  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment  Enron has long had travel policies in place  As we have grown we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader

	Air travel  Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park TAP or the GSSapproved preferred travel agency for your location  all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS  or httpclicktripenroncomenron the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts  Employees who fly in the United States should book nonrefundable coach tickets which are typically  percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a  fee  For this reason we strongly encourage all employees to purchase nonrefundable domestic coach tickets when possible

	Lodging  GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business units individual hotel policy  We recommend that you use Enrons list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business units policies  You can view the list at httptravelenroncom

	Car rental services  When renting a car for business travel employees should use our preferred car rental agencies  National US and Canada and Alamo US since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract  Visit httptravelenroncom for details and updates to services available outside the US

	Offsite meetings  All domesticUS offsite meetings and events with more than  people should be coordinated through GSS which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron  They can be reached at  

Because there are differences between business units and offices each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge  These recommendations are some basic sensible actions we can take companywide but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us please email us at recommendationsforcostsavingsenroncom   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on httpibuyitenroncomgssibuyitcsfaqdoc  If you have additional questions Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday June  at  am Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendationsGuys

  Fran and I have just noticed that two of the deals remarketed realtime were put on the ST NW book and the third was put on the W Hourly book

  We need to get together and chat so that we can keep this consistent and make sure that the right books recognize the changes

  Let me know if you will have time this afternoon by 
 If not lets plan to meet tomorrow

  Thanks

Could you take a look at what Ive put together Conceivably this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we or I could maintain which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management Thats a whole different subject  maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment At any rate this is a rough draft but I thought Id show it to you to make sure Im heading in the right direction

KateThe ISO is experiencing increasing loading on the PittsburgTassaraja kV
line and requires additional decremental energy bids on the north side of
the path and incremental energy bids on the south side of the path  To the
extent that Scheduling Coordinators do not respond with sufficient energy
bids to mitigate the anticipated congestion the ISO may invoke the other
steps of the IntraZonal Congestion Management Procedure  Sent by Market
Operations

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current
accurate information available in preparing this notice system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice Here are a couple of the highlights of todays ISO call		

  The ISO expects generators that are incapable of ramping up within  minutes to remain online at all times
  Because of software limitations marketers are still capable of setting the MCP  The ISO hopes to fix this within a few weeks at the earliest
  The ISO plans to publish the emission costs this week that will be charged to SCs for demand within California
  SCs scheduling wheelthrough transactions or exports out of California will not be subject to emission or startup fuel costs
  The ISO is dispatching generators during both emergency and nonemergency hours
  For purposes of determining when a new Stage  has occurred the ISO requires a minimum of  minutes   minutes before the operating hour plus the operating hour
  Under this requirement the ISO could be in Stage  for up to  minutes without triggering a new Stage  that is capable of resetting the proxy price

If you have any questions let me know

Several of our automated data acquisition and analysis systems have been interrupted since last Friday afternoon due to the Code Red worm thats been attacking federal web servers Apparently aimed initially at White House servers the worm quickly found its way to other federal servers and has now shut down all web service in the armymil domain including the Corp of Engineers which furnishes much of our hydro data Other internet sources have also been interrupted

Were working on alternative data sources and transfer methods but web site content will likely be spotty for the balance of the week Also were retaining the Mt Hood conference room for this afternoon but we wont have a structured presentation

 Though this is a mess I will attempt to explain the changes I have made given the information that I received from Bill Williams III this morning

   I took deal   from  to a  MW by adding an extra  MWs at a  price  LP owes us  for the energy that was ramped down because we buy it back from them  I added deal   to purchase back the  MW at a  price I put in a  price because we paid LP for these  MWs thru annuity   that pays LP  of what we sold the  MW for on real time deals    and  Please remember these changes span  days  and    

  I changed deal   from W Hourly book to ST NW because ST NW recognizes both purchase from PGE  and sale to Puget   There is an intradesk annuity   with which ST NW is compensating ST W Hourly for remarketing the power and an intradesk deal   with which ST W Hourly is compensating LT NW for the basis price of

As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post

Jeffrey K Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corps plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giants chief executive officer after only about six months in the job

In an interview yesterday the yearold Mr Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houstonbased Enron  On Tuesday Mr Skilling insisted he had resigned for personal reasons unrelated to Enron s business activities

In the interview he reiterated that he wasnt under any pressure to resign from the companys board or Chairman Kenneth Lay who has resumed the CEOs duties at the nations biggest energy trader

However yesterday Mr Skilling said that his personal reasons were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO Calling the companys stock performance a kind of ultimate score card Mr Skilling noted that Enron s share price had fallen by some  this year

Mr Skilling said he took that stockprice drop very personally I put a lot of pressure on myself for that decline he said I felt I must not be communicating well enough with investors He felt this particularly given Enron s strong financial results over the past several quarters based largely on growing volumes in its trading business which covers a range of items including electricity pulp and paper

If the stock price had remained up I dont think I would have felt the pressure to leave he said

In January Enron topped  a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading It closed Tuesday before the announcement of Mr Skillings resignation at  a share As of  pm yesterday Enron traded at  after falling below  during the day

Mr Skilling who had been at Enron  years said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees many of whom are shareholders People would say What is going on with the stock Jeff I would have to say I didnt know It has been frustrating said Mr Skilling

The selfportrait offered by Mr Skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious bright and thickskinned business strategist whose longheld goal had been becoming Enron CEO Mr Skilling said that the final straw in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the deaths of three Enron workers in a powerplant accident there That trip helped reinforce how tenuous life is said Mr Skilling who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged

While Mr Skilling said Enron is in great shape his departure raised anxiety in the investment community Merrill Lynch for instance lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on uncertainty created by the resignation

Yesterday an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr Lay plans to name two executives to the existing office of the chairman within the next few days or weeks The spokesman said Mr Lay hadnt yet revealed whom the two would be The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr Lay and Mr Skilling After the Day ahead market ran the PDCI TNOB branch group TTC in the
NS direction was changed from  MW to  MW for HEs  through
 for operating day   The reason for the change is for work on the
Valve Group  at Sylmar  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with
these values is HE   The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status  Sent by Market Operations inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk

Can you make sure that everyone in Real Time knows that if the ISO calls to remove a Waiver for a generator the Services Desk needs to be notified  Last evening apparently the ISO called and removed a waiver for Harbor with Craig and we were not notified  It is not his fault as we have not communicated the importance of this but from now on we need to be notified  This is because we will need to put in supplementals or at least be aware that we could be dispatched at any time once the waiver is pulled  It also gives us a heads up that the ISO needs energy

Cell Question of propriety might end access to control room
 
By Toby Eckert 
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
August   

WASHINGTON  Electricity buyers for the state are expected to lose access to a powergrid control room next month now that a California congressman has raised questions about the propriety of the arrangement 
But a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources which began buying electricity for the state during the ongoing power crisis denied the move was a response to Rep Doug Oses objections 
With the crisis no longer so acute there is less need for water resources personnel to have access to the Independent System Operators control room in Folsom said Oscar Hidalgo a water resources spokesman 
Were basically trying to cycle out of there he said 
Ose RSacramento spotlighted the water resources departments access to the control room during a House subcommittee hearing Aug  In a prepared statement he charged that the arrangement allowed the water resources department to cherrypick its power purchases 
Ose said the arrangement violated federal regulations and possibly cost Californians billions of dollars in potential refunds 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said Department of Water Resources contracts should not be subject to refunds the state is seeking for overpriced power contending the agency had a competitive advantage 
Among those who once had access to the room were four energy consultants to the state who were fired for owning stock in a power company from which they were purchasing electricity 
Appointees of Gov Gray Davis oversee both the ISO and the water resources department 
Hidalgo said water resources personnel needed access to the control room to coordinate power purchases during a crisis situation 
In order to keep the lights on in California this was something that was necessary we felt he said We did our best to minimize our exposure to any material that was not intended for our usage 
His comments echoed ISO President Terry Winters defense of the practice before the House subcommittee 
With numerous longterm power contracts in place and the threat of blackouts receding water resources has set a goal of removing all personnel from the control room by Sept  Hidalgo said 
Six water resources personnel still have access to the room he said 
Last week Winter sent a memo to Ose listing nine people who had access to the room and  others who no longer had access

FYI 

The CARP for  was not flat which wouldnt bother me so much if A Bert hadnt told me it was the one thing that was actually flat for the day and B Craig hadnt written Variance explained on the printout Explained variances do not consist of deals entered at the wrong price  ie the lending purchase from El Paso that weve been entering dayahead and reducing the price real time for the past month Because we left this price at  and didnt reduce it to the  service fee the STWBOM and STSW books each lost approx  in todays DPR

I know yesterday was messy and you werent left with a lot to go on but this is one pretty standard practice that shouldnt be overlooked Now dont get defensive  Im just reminding you

Thanks

Hey there ogre   Just teasing


Well unfortunately Im still up in the air over the Portland thing  It
doesnt make it any easier when I know that not only does one of my best
friends reside there but now I have a new lil buddy  I am so excited about
seeing Portland and meeting you  You are just as Brendan described  I just
cant imagine that that big deep voice comes out of such a baby face

Bill you know just how to push all the right buttons to get me to really
want to go  The second paragraph of your last Email made me so jealous
That was probably the most romantic setting and scene and to think that it
was written by a man  I am sooo impressed  You might not even know what
Im talking about  Typical male  hahaha  Just in case the roof
scene  Whats even better is that you werent trying to be suave

I think that your little city portrayal has just entered into the
things about Oregon I know Im going to love  Now well see if Sarah
has an open roof top  You did miss a couple of important features though
If I may Uh hmmm The scene lacks a certain social depth  It requires
a beautiful girlguy a light blanket soft music and if I drank wine which
I dont a bottle of Boones Farm Strawberry Hill   Ok the last part is
a joke I just dont know any other brands of wine   A nice bottled water
with lemon for me I suppose  Reverse Osmosis and filtration only  

Im sending a couple of pics of me from my Tahoe snowboarding trip last
December  They are actually the only ones I have in jpg format  I think
the only differences are that I have a little curlier hair now and its a
bit longer  But basically Im the same

Tell ya what if I do get to go I will get a hotel room not because I
dont trust you etc but because its just the right thing to do  Then
Ill give you a call or stalk your condo building looking for the resident
on the th floor Answering to Bill Williams III and that hangs out on
rooftops  Oh and the clencher Its located across the street from the
Paramount Hotel  Scary how I listen and pay attention to detail isnt it
You know Im joking Right  If I were like that Id jump at the chance
to stay with you

I really hope that I get to make it tomorrow  If not I know Ill get to see
you last of August  Im counting on it  Oh and you will stay with me at
the town house  I insist  Its a little different when a girl stays with a
guy then when a guy stays with a girl  It just looks better the other way
around  But like I said you WILL stay with me in August  Im  minutes to
the beach and maybe by then Ill have my California tan  Mmmm  Cant beat
that

Ok well Im going to bed  Ill call you to let you know what the plans are
My plane leaves at  am so I may not get the chance to Email you before
hand but well see

Good night

Subject	RE ISO Compliance Filing on June  FERC Order

Donna

This brings us back to the ageold question  During an emergency how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is  Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase  The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from instate munis LDWP SMUD etc but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion  And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty and another counterparty for a doover could be assessed  

We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages

Thank you for the information and the followup

All

I have reviewed documents from the ISOs website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June  FERC order and concluded the following 

 During a System Emergency a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage and 

 During a NonSystem Emergency a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour 

If you have any questions at all I can be reached at extension   

Thanks

 Bill Mike Cashell MPCs Transmission Mgr just phoned me concerned beca
use MPCs RealTime group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our
 existing Energy Imbalance structure and was notified by our RealTime gro
up that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap we were have difficult
y securing any resources  Just to clarify things we are settling MPCs Ch
oice customers Energy Imbalance position and PPL Montana has the right to
 any length resulting from MPCs domestic load Energy Imbalance  In othe
r words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts so during t
he hour they may be turning energy back to PPL Montana while at the same 
time finding themselves short for the Choice loads  During the recent bull
ish pricing conditions Choice customer were leaving themselves long as of
 late MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite positio
ning themselves short  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expe
cting us to fill a short position from this point on so Id really like to
 see what we can do to honor their requests mindful of the favorable posit
ion weve enjoyed over the last several months Let me know if youd like t

Liz Taylor for Greg WhalleyHeather

  According to our conversation on how to account for the  MWs missing on  from deal   I have done the following

  I found deal   that was entered by Bill Williams to account for these extra  MWs  However this deal was entered as a purchase annuity from LTNW to MPC  I didnt find any other deals for Real Time to pay back LTNW

  SO I extended LTNW deal   in EnPower Scheduling so that MPC could be kept whole then I took Bills annuity deal   changed it to a purchase annuity from the STWHOURLY book to the LTNW and changed the price from  to  to compensate STNW for the energy not sold by Real Time 

  I hope this info will help you in calculating the DPR of these  deals especially with a counterparty change

  Please see me with any questions

  VirginiaHere is the transcript of the ISOs realtime desk asking Enron realtime trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO set the marketclearing price MCP for replacement energy  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at  because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny and now market participants were buying the ISOs excess energy a penny after having sold it to the ISO for  the day before

There are two phone calls  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didnt put in the bid  Our trader told the ISO that he had to talk to his boss because he didnt want to do anything wrong  

Note  I have just learned a complicating detail  Coincidentally our desk did put in a bid for  for Hour  which was what the ISO had requested  However the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISOs Real Time Desk and Enrons Real Time Desk  July     

Enron  Enron this is David Porter

ISO  Hi David  This is Allen at the ISO

Enron  David Hi Allen  How ya doing

ISO  Allen  Hold on one sec  Ive got to get something

Unknown  Stage one at 

ISO  Allen  Hey Im on the hourahead desk  Did you guys put a bid in

Enron  David  Yes hang on one second Allen

ISO  Allen  Yeah

Enron  Ryan  This is Ryan Slinger

ISO  Allen  Hey Ryan this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead  Did you guys put a trade in replacement energy  Not trade but a bid

Enron  Ryan  For which hour for hour 

ISO  Allen  For hour 

Enron  Ryan  For hour  correct

ISO  Allen  Can you guys continue to put the price at that

Enron  Ryan  At what  At 

ISO  Allen  Yes

Enron  Ryan  Um

ISO  Allen  This isnt on a recorded line but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing  It would be good to keep it the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy at a higher price  It doesnt matter how many megawatts you  put it at but we want to clear it at a higher price

Enron  Ryan  Wait you said were not on a recorded line or we are

ISO  Allen  Were not  No were not okay  We already talked to the dayahead research guy and myself but we saw you guys clear at  and we wanted you if its possible to continue to set that whether its  MW or whatever you want to put in there

Enron  Ryan  Okay um

ISO  Allen  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market

Enron  Ryan  Oh yeah  Because it had been clearing like at  hadnt it

ISO  Allen  Not replacement

Enron  Ryan  Oh not replacement

ISO  Allen  No  What happened is that we bought it backsee the dayahead was purchased at like  and then what happened is that the hourahead   a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the inter ties  They were faking it  So we wanted to keep the price up high   

Allen and Ryan  Unintelligible

Enron  Ryan  So they were selling it oh in the day ahead and buying it back

ISO  Allen  Buying like  bucks   trying to make money off of it then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny

Enron  Ryan  Oh thats ridiculous

ISO  Allen  Thats really ticking us off and right now   

Enron  Ryan  That to me signals thats probably Powerex isnt it

ISO  Allen  Theres about four of them right now

Enron  Ryan  Shit

ISO  Allen  And for the dayahead for tomorrow we didnt we didnt we took them out  Basically were not allowing  anything over the ties

Enron  Ryan  I didnt submit one for  or 

ISO  Allen  Thats fine  Theyll probably go to a penny and theyll probably get excited and do a bunch and well hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at  or 

Enron  Ryan  Okay  All right  Well Ill see what I can do

ISO  Allen  I appreciate it  Its actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO with what these guys are doing so we are trying to put a stop to it

Enron  Ryan Okay

ISO  Allen  Thanks bye

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISOs Real Time Desk and Enrons Real Time Desk  July       minutes later

Thanks An interesting anecdote about your good friend Gray

	This man in his official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of 	ethics or conflict of interests South asserted Hes a pure political phony

THE STATE
Renewed Ethics Attacks Put Davis on the Defensive
 Politics The governors conflictofinterest problems with his energy advisors give GOP rival Bill Jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign 

by MARK Z BARABAK TIMES POLITICAL WRITER


In  when Gray Davis first ran for governor his Republican rival tested a series of attacks on Davis ethical conduct

There were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding Davis voracious fundraising activities

But when voters heard the allegations they simply shrugged them off The response was Hes a politician Of course he does stuff like that recalled one GOP strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for Republican nominee Dan Lungren The campaign shelved its line of attack and Democrat Davis romped to a landslide victory

Now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses this time surrounding the states electricity crisis The issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the states power crunch appears to have finally eased

The charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of Bill Jones the Republican secretary of state and Davis sole declared rival in the race for governor Last week Jones called the conflictofinterest allegations one of the most significant pervasive and costly ethics scandals in California history

But as yet there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of Davis energy advisors let alone the governor himself And unless there is some proof many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governors reelection prospects in November 

I dont see this becoming a dominant campaign issue said Jim Knox executive director of California Common Cause the good government group and one of Davis most prominent critics Its likely that the more resonant issue    is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved

That said Knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in Lungrens focus group interviews

The danger is that this could undermine the publics confidence in state governments ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest Knox said It does surprise me that the governors office with all of its experience and talent could so cavalierly disregard the states conflictofinterest laws which to me appears to be what happened

The controversy involves nearly a dozen Davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in California Their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statementsrevelations that resulted in part from Jones pressure Five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations

Garry South the governors chief political strategist points to the firings as evidence of Davis probity Clearly if the governors office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there they would not have been fired South said

As for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governors staffor anyone in state governmentowning stock in any company whatsoever South said

Even so Davis top spokesman Steve Maviglio earlier this month sold his  shares of stock in a California power company after news of his holdings surfaced Maviglio said he lost  in the transaction

At the least the revelations have been a distraction for Davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackoutfree summer

It is a mistake that didnt need to be made and shouldnt have been made said Gale Kaufman a Sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare Democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor The fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didnt need

Republicans of course see a larger problem

Hes either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration said Rob Stutzman a spokesman for the California Republican Party And we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him

In characteristically pugnacious fashion the Davis campaign has sought to turn Jones charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain

This man in his official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests South asserted Hes a pure political phony

But Jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the states chief elections officer For the governors office to say that I dont have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldnt be able to speak to it is patently false Jones said

New Life for Jones Campaign

Whatever his stake there is no question that the attention has given life to Jones campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid

The  in contributions that Jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by California standards and the Bush White House has all but formally endorsed rival Richard Riordan who is still exploring the race

Fellow Republican William E Simon Jr a Los Angeles investment banker has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy

But ironically for all Jones efforts it may be Riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy Unlike Simon a political neophyte and Jones an year officeholder Riordan had a decadeslong business career before serving two terms as Los Angeles mayor

Hes cut from a different cloth said Don Sipple a GOP strategist who is neutral in the governors race If this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game Riordan can point to the fact he didnt start public service until he was more than  years old

But even while insisting that Davis did nothing wrong strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governors professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment And Davis best defense they argue is his famously modest lifestylea frugality symbolized during his  campaign by his cramped West Hollywood home

If anyone thinks Davis has used his office to get rich one advisor said All wife Sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo




Amy 

Thats the best news Ive heard all day Looks like were getting this checkout process down to a science As far as the new scheduling fee Im being told that were still negotiating a way to enter this into Enpower Ill let you know once Ive talked with Cara and Greg to determine whether or not it will be a price adjustment per MW on each deal or a lump sum annuity each month In the meantime just let me know when you have more information on the buyresale prices  I think I have an answer for you

Kate  Kathy has asked me about this annuity 

 you will be billing us an annuity for  for the month of
July for a scheduling fee of  cents per MWH associated with our
preschedules that Portland puts together for us  This will continue from
now on   Could you lump this monthly amount in with our total mwh purchase
amount on the invoice

Where will I see this  I need it to be entered into EnPower in order to bill them   also will this be captured in the model

Let me know  that is the only question I have for July  Except the BR in the model is different fromt he BR prices in EnPower  I am trying to figuire where they are off  Once I do that will be the only change besides this annuity that I will need you to make THE RECONCILIATION THIS MONTH WAS GREAT  Thanks so much for your attention  Amy

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston Amy Clemons and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out  She said that would accomplish the same thing

Pete is out of the office until Monday but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this

Hello there mister Bill

Just a quick note to say sorry for getting off of the phone so quickly
yesterday  To get into my apartment you have to go through a security gate
that needs to be opened by a resident  I didnt have my pass code and I had
a visitor  So I was scrammbling around like a lunatic trying to find it
Most everyone who comes to visit knows the pass code so when someone new
comes to visit I have to try to remember what it is  Then enter it into the
phone to let them in  I think Ive used it like twice in the year Ive
lived here  Anyhow so thats that

To be quite honest with you I was so frazzled that I have no idea what you
said you needed to do or if you said I could call back after a certain time
My mind was just focused on that code  I thought I remembered that you
couldnt talk to me the rest of the day  Thats why I didnt call  Ok
theres all the excuses and apologies

Hope youre having a great day

Erin  EmilyAfter careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers I decided to leave Copper on for Friday night   There were several reasons for this decision including the PV outage  the fact that Newman  was only released for  megawatts and the fact that when we needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing it up  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the right thing to due given those factors  If either of you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact me  Thanks GUZTo All

As per todays  conversation with Keoni Almeida Enrons customer rep at the CAISO the CAISO has been directed by their board to post only the Market Clearing prices  What this means is the following

During Normal operating periods the Market Clearing Price may be the true cost of energy in the ISO  The component that could be missing is the cost and volume of the Out Of Market calls if any  but theres no way to know since this information is not posted

During any Stage  market mitigation procedures the Market Clearing Price is the highest Proxy Price of the least efficient unit selected under the mitigation procedures The ISO is setting the emission credit value to zero and the proxy has never included gas transportation costs the proxy MCP is not really a measure of marginal cost  Further the proxy MCP excludes the cost and volumes of the Out Of Market calls and any accepted payasbid costs and volumes

To find the MCP Proxy Price during Stage  the following link httpwwwcaisocommarketopsOASISpubmkthtml button number 

The impacts of the lack of this information include but are not limited to our knowing what the realtime cost of going short as a scheduling coordinator would be or the actual cost of congestion  Not having access to the complete pricing picture hampers the ability of the realtime traders in the west from making the best business decisions possible

Since it has been articulated by Kenoi that the CAISO Board has made a conscious decision not to post a complete picture of the costs of energy from hour to hour it would seem that it would be appropriate for Enron to consider making an attempt to persuade the ISO to reconsider its decision and that it would be of significant benefit to the market and the ISO to publish all pertinent pricing data

Do you agree  If yes how do we proceed  If no why not

Thanks

Just wanted to let you know we have a new generator coming on line Desert Power  They have  units totaling mw located in Utah and they are in Pacificorps service territory  Please remember they are in Mountain Time so please be careful when speaking with them try to always speak in hour ending  Mountain Time  

They are running this afternoon Wednesday  for the first time  For the first week or so they will be working the kinks out in the realtime market  The easiest thing to do would be to either sell them directly to Pacificorp or to buy a wheel from PACE to Four Corners or another point of delivery via Pacificorps oasis website  The contract language is set up to where we get MWh for dispatching the unit plus an incentive to sell them above a certain percentage of the Dow Jones PV dayahead index  So during the testing phase please just take MWh when youre selling the unit output

If you have any questions Mike Etringer was the guy who put this deal together Les is also familiar with the deal as am I to a smaller extent

description  But I believe she is on vacation fighting forest fires

This table is used in a process submission and assessment of ETags and is
somewhat independent of the time zones that the product or commodity is
referenced by  Guess Im letting my preference slip in here  since we are
dealing with a daily process the timing table should use a prevailing time
reference eg LCA or PPT etc and not a fixed time zone eg PST
CST etc

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston Amy Clemons and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out  She said that would accomplish the same thing

Please let me know if you have any suggestions

KateMike McDonald and I met with WAPA and the Bureau of Reclamation on Tuesday  and learned some interesting information about their relationship with PGE  On Oct th PGE filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA  Currently PGE looks at the imbalance energy positive or negative at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month  As a result WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out

As of OCt th all this changes  WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PGE imbalance prices which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets  We probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list

Officials study grids close call 
Published Friday Aug   in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY STEVE JOHNSON JOHN WOOLFOLK AND GLENNDA CHUI 

Mercury News 


Two energy agencies announced Thursday that they are investigating charges some California generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity and Atlantabased Mirant admitted it had a role in last weeks incident that briefly imperiled the Western power grid

California officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on Aug  and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to  million people 

But it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again 

Some generators and a federal official questioned the California Independent System Operators handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified

But Stephanie McCorkle with the California agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didnt follow orders And she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity

We asked them over and over why theyre not following our dispatch instructions she said adding that some have provided explanations that dont add up It makes us suspicious

McCorkle said the Aug  incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power That left the Western grid  a vast network of highvoltage lines transformers and other electrical gear that spans  states and parts of Canada and Mexico  with a sudden and severe electrical shortage If uncorrected she and others said it could have led to widespread power outages

Although officials need to keep the grids electrical frequency at  hertz the Aug  shortage lowered it to  hertz State officials said blackouts could occur at  hertz

McCorkle declined to name the companies involved But Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for Mirant which has three plants in the Bay Area said it was partly responsible While offering few details about what happened he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee not making a timely call and some software problems with our computers

It happens Dorinson said People make mistakes

An official with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission one of the agencies investigating the matter said it views the Aug  incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesnt happen again The agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order But at this point the official said its unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices 

The official said the agency also wants to know why the California Independent System Operator didnt declare a statewide emergency on Aug  when the promised electricity wasnt delivered Had it done so he said the agency would have had more leverage over the generators

Some power company representatives complained that the ISO doesnt always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs For many plants it takes a lot longer than  minutes to ramp up said Richard Wheatley a spokesman with Reliant Energy of Houston You physically cant do it

But ISO officials defended their procedures and spokesman Gregg Fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on Aug  wouldnt have been feasible

This was so quick he said It was less than half an hour total from start to finish and we were able to deal with it appropriately without suffering blackouts

The incident also is being looked into by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials which sets rules for managing grids in the regions nearly  million square miles

Robert Dintelman the agencys assistant executive director said brief electricity fluctuations such as the one that hit California or worse occur once or twice a month across the West On Aug  for example the frequency dipped to  in Montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there Dintelman said

But he said Californias claim that generators arent following orders is unusual That is alarming he added

The council can issue fines for some rule violations But Dintelman said hes not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power

Nationally such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak said Ellen Vancko of the North American Electric Reliability Council Her group has been pushing Congress to make the system tougher but the legislation has stalled Meanwhile she said grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide

Although the motivation for these incidents varies she said sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk

Ph The FERC apparently has a very short memory


	In its Dec   Order FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for  days after the transaction was filed with FERC   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov  through April  are subject to refund  The Dec  Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability  Otherwise refund potential for transactions over MWh would close after  days  Presumably liability for transactions under MWh would close after  days too

Here is the excerpt from the Dec  Order

We clarify that unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a particular transaction will close  days after the initial report is filed with the Commission  The institution of a day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff  Dec  Order at 


  	In its Nov  Order FERC said that it would limit refund liability to sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costsmuch less opportunity coststo offset potential refunds

From the Nov  Order  However should we find it necessary to order refunds we will limit refund liability to no lower than the sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  Nov  Order at 


FERCs July  Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding  Arbitrary and capricious anyone

Dear Traders

  Please be advised that the following worksheet is a summary of transmission ancillary charges  These charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them  To figure approximately how much each MW of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied use the following worksheet adding each of the  ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost

  For example  

   I reserve  MWs of Sierra Pacific transmission
 
  Scheduling Fees   			 MWs x     
  Reactive Supply and Voltage fees 	 x  x  x

				Please note that if energy prices are higher this line loss charge will be higher too  ie  if prices are at  this charge will be

Hey Guys

The ISO cutting our offpeak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels 

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP PGE across the path to relieve the congestion If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be  cong  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut I would recommend to put in the max number of MWs you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert Go big in the offpeak we submitted MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights 
 
GeirBecause were under close watch by El Paso would you mind looking over this email to Kathy before I send it out Thanks

Kathy 

I requested tapes for  to verify the amount we purchased from SRP and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power Vanessa at SRP said shed need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all for HE   mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at FourCorners Our records also show we bought  mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day So total SRP purchase for HE  is  mw  mw lending deal   mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements 

Im working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers  Ill let you know as soon as we find that In the meantime do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased  mw of econ energy for HE  Im just not finding anything to support that

Thanks

 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests
JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS


Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned 
In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled 
Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid  a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional  million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines 
Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction 
The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than  consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year 
More than  million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records 
In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within  days of starting work for state agencies 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants 
 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the  billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than  records show 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than  million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available 
We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview 
The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a  contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid  an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as  in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment 
The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation 
Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between  and  a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California 
Mead  a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares   years ago for  and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time 
Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired 
I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated 
I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July  three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment 
Griffin reported purchasing  to  of Calpine stock on Feb  in her final days working at the electricity exchange 
A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources 
On Feb  Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional  billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb  was the longest 
The state has awarded Calpine about  billion in contracts to supply power for up to  years 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation 
Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about  in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb  
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July  that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job 
That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer 
We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters 
Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person 
However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects 
Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record 
Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state 
That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests 
The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract

Gentlemen

Delano is prescheduled to return from their outage beginning HE on Monday   However if you can buy the energy back HE below  their variable costs please do so  If prices warrant you will purchase mw SP HE  I will tee up Delano for this play please stay in contact with the control room to let them know whats going on

As far as the price goes we proposed to Delano that we would split the profit with them  So split the delta between what youre able to buy for and their variable costs   For example if youre able to purchase the energy at  put in a purchase from whoever at  then a sale to Delano at  giving Delano  and realtime   The Services Desk out of the goodness of our hearts is not going to take anything from this transaction



We have one more issue with Delano on Monday  HE they are prescheduled at mw but they will be able to produce mw so we will possibly have mw to sell for them  They are going to let me know what they want to do  They will either have us sell it realtime run uninstructed against the ISO dec or ramp down their generation to reflect their preschedule

I will keep you posted on what they want to do

Subject  Copper


After careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers I
decided to leave Copper on for Friday night   There were several
reasons for this decision including the PV outage  the fact that
Newman  was only released for  megawatts and the fact that when we
needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing
it up  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the
right thing to due given those factors  If either of you have any
questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me  Thanks GUZ

Bill Williams III from the real time desk has asked me to contact you to see if you could ask the ISO to resume publishing the as bid and Out Of Market cost information for imbalance energy purchases  According to Bills contact at the ISO Keoni the ISO made the decision to publish only the proxy price but not the accepted bids exceeding the proxy price The as bid information needs to be published so that SCs can get real time price signals about imbalance energy charges  The proxy price is not enough to determine the cost of imbalance energy because the ISO doesnt buy all of its energy at the proxy price  Some will be purchased at the proxy price some at bids exceeding the proxy and some through OOM calls  Absent this information SCs incurring imbalance charges will not find out what their costs are for  daysHey why arent you on MSN instant messenger Whats the deal with that

BillADS users

I have received numerous comments from TSWG regarding concerns about the
planned implementation of the same service type for OOS and OOM type
dispatches in ADS phase II    Market Operations current position is that
the Market Participants have all the information they need to decode OOS and
OOM such as what has been bid what has been dispatched what proxy bids
have been created based on available capacity etc  However we will
consider a change to separate the OOS and OOM dispatches  In order to fully
weigh the ramifications of this decision I want to solicit
examplesscenarios where Market Participant systems would not be able to
correctly settle against a combined OOSOOM dispatch through ADS

If you are interested in this issue please strengthen your case by sending
me an email with comments by   I would especially like to see
comments regarding how mustoffer fits in including issues with proxy bids
and whether OOM will apply to must offer units

Hey there

Oh I was sooo upset  It didnt rain thunder sprinkle shoot it wasnt even
humid or misty  I got screwed    Ok it wasnt all that bad  I actually
had a really great time  Imagine someone actually going on vacation to see
it pour rain  Sick sick individual

Lets see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil miss
Nikki to be a spy  Portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of
down town  There were so many things to do and see  Unfortunately because
we didnt exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we
just wondered around aimlessly


Then on Saturday we all drove to Astoriayou knew I just had to go  It
was great  Absolutely beautiful  On the way we stopped at the fresh berry
market and had the most amazing berries Oh they were good  Next we ate
at a little fish place mmmmclam chowder and fried seafood  Then went to
Cannon Beach  What a great little town  I bought some pulled taffy and
some hot chocolate and was in heaven  Alot of the beach sites  for
example Haystack rock were in the Goonies film  Then of course I found the
little hotel that Kindergarten Cop was filmed in  what a loser I was
taking pictures like a fool

Bill you dont understand for years and years every Saturday after cartoons
I would pop KC into the VCR  I loved it Ok ok dorky but hey you have to
have some abnormalities in your life

Then if you havent been here I am going to be the one to take you for your
first timeif youll let me  And hey dont get any wild hairs about
exploring this before hand misterIm the tour guide on this baby 
Its outside of Cannon Beach just past Hug point  Its a little trek called
Falcon Cove  you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we
went on

Finally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive
downtown  Bush Gardens  Blech  Horrible I felt like I had licked the
hair on my dogs butt  Oooo it was just gross

Then of course I got to meet you  That was a nice highlight to my trip
You rate right up there along side the KC hotel rooms  yeah I kinda like
ya  

Next morning I ate the best breakfast of my entire life  Not kidding  Its
something like the Otwalia  Its in the Westin hotel  Ok we all shared
our plates so this was our breakfastsSarah got a fruit plate I got eggs
benedict and Todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter
and syrup  Swear to God that is the first place I want to go to eat when I
get to go back  Ok it was a little pricey though  Not tooo bad  it was
 for  of us  Not alot but breakfast is usually like  bucks

The next two days were spent in Hood River Cascade Lockes  We hiked the
Mananomah whatever falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around
the town of StevensWA   miles  I was really hurting by that night 
of the trail was up hill  Oh my tail end hurt like crazy  In Stevens we
ate at a little snack shop  It was probably one of the better places  Oh
what was its name  Oh Little Vikings  Really cute place  Youve gotta
go  Oh one more that I wont recommendTugboat Annies in Hood River
Again I felt like I had given an ATB to someone  Too fancy  Im a meat and
potatoe girl  That fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over
do it

WE ate at Stanfords the last day and it was another fancy place  I ordered
onion rings and they were good  The salad was horrible  So on a food
rating scale POrtlandOregon recieves a   I guess Im just not going to
the right places

As you can tell by the length of this I am at work and needing to use some
of my time up  You are the poor sap Ive chosen since you dont know me
yet

Well the move out date is set for me  I move out on July   Im not too
sure when the townhouse will be available though so Im playing it by ear
DO you have any idea when your trip out there might fall  If you have a
ball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates  I just want
to be sure that Im off of work as much as possible the day or days that you
have elected to spend with me  That is if you still want to spend them with
me  I mean I did sort of stalk your house and found out where you
livedthat cant be good 

Ok I honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation  Im just
sort of a small town girl who knows that those things really arent
appropriate but do them regardless  Youll understand once we become better
friends  I warned you a little though  I did say that I was spontaneous
and might just show up on your doorstep  Well there you go I did

Please dont tell Brendan  You probably already did  I actually need to
Email him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you
The small amount of time I got to spend with you was very nice  I look
forward to doing that again sometime  Well just up hte time slot a hair

Ok I will let your weary eyes seetle back to work  Oh I did receive your
voicemail on my phone but it was in NM  I wouldnt have had time anyhow but
thank you for your hospitality and the offer  I cant wait to reciprocate
it in CAli

Take care

Subject	RE Two Major Inconsistencies in FERCs Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov  and Dec  Orders

Hi Dave

Of course the decision is politically motivated  But arent they all  Its just that now its our ox being gored

In general review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential ie courts give agencies a lot of discretionwhich is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision  But if a court concludes that the agencys action was arbitrary and capricious it may overturn the decision  Our argument would be that FERC is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregardedwithout explanationits earlier rulings in this case  Its no slam dunk but its the best argument we have  We will never win an argument in any court that FERC could have or should have crafted its order a certain way a court will almost always say the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit  However courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of Constitutional Due Process

As for the publics opinion of Enron as a profiteerfor better or worse its already established  And no matter what action we take Davis will cast a negative spin on it  So why not fight for our interests  The stakes in this order are worth it  This recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model power marketing its hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs  The generators get to offset refunds with input costs we should be able to use our purchased power costs  I dont see much downside for us to argue that FERC should keep its word that  refunds can only be ordered within  days and  all sellers are entitled to marginal costs  We are just holding the Commission to its promise  At a minimum the Commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings

These are good questions  Have a good weekend 

I copied Alan on this because I thought he might be interested in our colloquoy

Aside from the fact that the entire play by the FERC in the last  months has been purely politically motivated are we going to challenge the latest rulings in court  Can we challenge this apparent lack of consistency memory loss

If we were to challenge do you think the general public opinion and impression of Enron as a henious profiteer from Houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challenge

Just curious about what your thoughtsplanned recommendation are

Thanks for the information

Subject	Two Major Inconsistencies in FERCs Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov  and Dec  Orders

The FERC apparently has a very short memory


	In its Dec   Order FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for  days after the transaction was filed with FERC   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov  through April  are subject to refund  The Dec  Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability  Otherwise refund potential for transactions over MWh would close after  days  Presumably liability for transactions under MWh would close after  days too

Here is the excerpt from the Dec  Order

We clarify that unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a particular transaction will close  days after the initial report is filed with the Commission  The institution of a day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff  Dec  Order at 


  	In its Nov  Order FERC said that it would limit refund liability to sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costsmuch less opportunity coststo offset potential refunds

From the Nov  Order  However should we find it necessary to order refunds we will limit refund liability to no lower than the sellers marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs  Nov  Order at 


FERCs July  Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding  Arbitrary and capricious anyone

As we have moved into the shoulder months of September and October we need to be aware that the El Paso load curve is shifting  This means you will slowly start seeing a greater morning ramp than in the past few months  We need to keep this in mind and utilize the dispatch and load curves supplied to us by El Paso to ensure a smooth morning ramp  For the past two days the night shift has oversold for HE  to the point of having to turn on the steamers both days  There is no reason that we shold be selling HE  and turning on the steamers at the same time   Be very careful NOT TO OVERSELL FOR HE   If you have any questions about load curves feel free to talk with Bill or a senior member of the group  CheersGUZThe following appointments have been made for your meetings in Portland  FYIMurray ONeil and Jake Thomas are out of the office this week and will be unable to meet with you  Murray spends a lot of time in Houston and you might be able to schedule a meeting with him there  Mollie can help you make other arrangements for you to meet with Jake  Let me know if you have any questions or need any further assistance

KateDue to the relatively weak realtime market during morning hours we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buyingback generation that youve sold forward  We want to stress that this is a relatively shortterm strategy  As the weather turns cold during the lateAutumn and Winter months the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the realtime market

Lately HE have been very weak realtime ranging between  and   We have two strategies that we would like to suggest

  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate  Basically we would be letting the ISO know that were willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mws from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity  You are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it from the ISO  For example if your cost to generate is  and you sell dayahead for  you make MWh  If the ISO takes the decremental bid and the price is  then you make MWh   

Advantages  A relatively large upside the price the ISO charges could actually go negative as large as negative   Also you would actually be buying from the ISO as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk

Disadvantages  Ten minute dispatch  When we submit decremental bids the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every  minutes  In addition to the physical problems this might create the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow

  BuyingBack Blocks in the BiLateral Market
This strategy calls for our realtime traders to buy blocks of energy in the bilateral market for below your cost to generate  This would call for you to reduce your generation and the energy we buyback in the realtime market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity  Once again you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it at the price paid to buyback the energy   As in the previous example if your cost to generate is  and you sell dayahead for  you make MWh  If we can buyback the energy for a price of  then you make MWh   Additionally if we do buyback the energy we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order  Then if the ISO takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit 

Advantages  No  minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced  Also the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage

Disadvantage  Not as large of an upside as decremental bidding

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy  buyingback blocks of energy in the bilateral market  Once you and our realtime traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO  We propose a  profit split above your dayahead profit earned from either of these two strategies

The Montana Power Company

Butte Montana  

	Re	 Arrangements to Accommodate FERCs June   Order

Dear 

	The Montana Power Company MPC and Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI are parties to a Confirmation Letter dated December   the term of which has been extended by letter dated  under which EPMI has been purchasing energy for resale to MPC or selling energy received from MPC into the wholesale market  As you are no doubt aware the FERC issued an Order on June   that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the WSCC  

One restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers such as EPMI may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the California ISO California Cap  Generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices  As a result at times such as during this weeks heat wave which caused blackouts in Las Vegas EPMI may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the West at a price below the California Cap  Because EPMI cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the California Cap to MPC we cannot purchase such energy on MPCs behalf for resale to MPC  

However in order to continue to serve MPCs needs at times of peak demand scarce supply and high prices EPMI proposes the following solution

	If EPMI is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the California Cap EPMI will strive to meet MPCs energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to MPC and for MPC to pay the generator directly 
	EPMI will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer who will be paying the generator directly for that energy
	EPMI will notify MPC of the identity of the seller along with the amount to be paid the seller and provide other information and assistance to enable MPC to pay the seller directly 
	All other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged
 
	We believe this proposal allows EPMI to continue to meet MPCs needs while complying with Federal law  If you have another proposal or would like to discuss this matter further please feel free to call either Christian Yoder at   or Steve Hall at    

Otherwise kindly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to this amendment by signing in the place provided below

 I have one more thing to add to the list of Enpower requests

Deals done under the EPMI Short Term West Hourly desk do not need to be confirmed The Real Time traders know they need to check No in the Confirmation box in Deal Entry however its one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked It occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of Real Time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed  and unnecessarily confusing counterparties  if we could make No confirmation an automatic default for all deals entered under the Short Term West Hourly book 

I cant think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change but lets discuss that during the next Enpower meeting Please let me know what we can do to get this implemented

Thanks for your help

Now its time to look forward
With Jeff leaving the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board  I have agreed  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible  Our performance has never been stronger our business model has never been more robust our growth has never been more certain and most importantly we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company  We have the finest organization in American business today  Together we will make Enron the worlds leading company

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time

A Real Time Question
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance as it sometimes is at night will this application still function  If not we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained

Path Confirmation

Speed is very much an issue here  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths The confirmation of  paths as a group took  seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ok button until the confriming was completed This is too long we need this to be  seconds max Currently this process takes about  seconds in lotus

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report This also took over a minute  This is another  second process in lotus

One little housekeeping thing  can we move the delete button away from the confrim button  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button  This will save us mucho headaches later OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion

 Several generators will have energy available for the weekend because day ahead prices did not reach their thresholds so they scheduled less than the amount available  If Real TIme prices do exceed their thresholds please call them and buy their power and ramp them up  Sunday looks like it will happen for a good piece of the peak hours so focus on Sunday  You will need to inc their gen schedules

Saturday
Delano  			 MW Off Peak Only  Price Threshold    Preschedule  MW increase to

In addition it is possible that any of these units or Harbor could be dispatched by the ISO pursuant to the FERC order  This will probably not occur as the ISO will not need their energy over the weekend but if it does we should relay these instructions to the generator ramp them up and put a deal in the system as we would a supplemental  This should be a pass through for EPMI

As you may already know the Short Term West Hourly desk began trading the Enron Online hourly market on Monday These deals should be treated just like all Short Term West Hourly deals  they do not need to be confirmed Unfortunately it seems the EOL application created for us is defaulting to YesConfirm and West Hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters 

Ive spoken with the EOL help desk about changing this default setting and theyve informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change In the meantime I wanted to make you aware of these deals existence You will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the Short Term West Hourly desk in the future and many of these will be made on EOL Again these should be treated as with any other West Hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed

Please let me know if you have any questions about this Ill let you know as soon as Ive heard more conclusive information from EOL And thanks for your help

Arco is going down for a few hours in the morning on Thursday  to conduct some maintenance  They are prescheduled at mw but from HE  they will only be able to produce mw  So please reduce their generation schedule and purchase mw HE in SP for them

Also for HE of those mw that you purchase for Arco please sell mw to ST West Services deal  and then sell to Arco deal  for the same price that you sold to West Services  The remainder just sell straight to Arco  This needs to be done because there were some funky schedule adjustments by the ISO  Basically the ISO cut Arcos dayahead schedule by mw for HE so West Services had wear that in order for the dayahead Enpower to Caps report to tie out

One more thing the ISO also adjusted several other generator schedules for HE on Thursday   I emailed the generators who were affected Sierra Wheelabrator Martel and Nove  I told them that we resubmitted all their schedules in the hour ahead market and that we were relatively confident that their preferred schedules would be awarded hour ahead  But if they so desired they could call into the realtime desk one hour before the flow to check the hourahead final  That way the could make any adjustments to their generation if necessary  So you might get a few calls in the middle of the night from a few generators to check their final hourahead schedules  But to be honest I highly doubt youll get any calls  I know you wont get a call from Nove or Sierra if you do get a call it might be from Wheelabrator Martel 

Thanks a bunch

I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a monthlong position i
n August  I would like to buy a piece of NP sell a piece of SP and sell 
PV I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the realtim
e market throughout August  NP and SP are currently trading near flat  I 
think the potential for realtime congestion revenueRT has seen approximat
ely  so far this month across constrained paths in California make
s this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market I have d
iscussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso While I recognize the re
st of the desk has a position I think RT can generate good value liquidati
ng in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dai
lies because of the current price levels  This also represents a relativel
y low risk trade under  downside  I also would like to use these posi
tions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well  If you have concerns or qu
estions please let me know otherwise I will put these positions on over th
e next week

Thanks
BillTrader on this deal is Bert Meyers Ive left him a message to come in a little early for the meeting today so we can settle this However it looks like everything on our side has been taken care of  Virginia says both Montana and Tacoma agree HE  should be zeroed out which is what we show in Enpower It appears weve been charged for the change in sale volume but not credited for the change in purchase volume  am I right

So at this point do we need to bother the trader with this And what do you mean by it being in or out Another deal We shouldnt need one

Let me know when you get a chance

Good point Bill  Now that we are sure what happened to  is correct I am following up with Settlements group in Houston regarding the other side of the deal ie   Somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details  I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty

If this deal was zeroed out and it has been after the fact then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC the other side of the deal 
deal  We should only lose  the net difference Any ideas

Virgina and Bill

During our monthend processes I have researched deal   The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE   Originally the deal liquidated with HE MWh HEMWh  and HE MWh but on  the volume for HE was zeroed out in scheduling which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE back

Thanks

I have one question on this months PMA and some questions from last month  First for deal  this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  Are we being charged for each counterparty again like EES and STCali last month if so we need to fix this flawed tool 

Second for last month we determined that the WBOM book needs a  PMA for change in price  The appropriate price is in Enpower but the revenue has never appeared Deal  Remember this deal was originally input as a buy at  and a sell at  and liquidated at these prices The deal is now at  and   What do we need to do to get this trued up
Please come see me with questions

Thank you for your help

We are  MW long all hours at Montana System  which is our buy from MPC deal number 

The upstream is PSEIDUKEWWPMPCO

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule and that tag is 

When we get close to HE  on Monday that Tag needs to go away and the energy needs to be sold

Please dont say it was a false preschedule just say that it was unexpectedly ramped down or something

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

Following are two glitches the Real Time group has run across with the Forward Obs report As I understand Dave Poston is getting set to roll out a new version of Enpower Position Manager which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run Forward Obs included but in the meantime these are the problems weve seen Thanks so much for your help on this

 REPORT NOT READING TWO IDENTICAL STRIPS  When deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours same volume same price and same counterparty using the same deal number the report only reads one strip For example on  deal  was previously entered as a sale to the California Imbalance for  mw HE  and two separate but identical strips of  mw for HE  The report read all  mw HE  but only  mw HE  I zeroed out one  mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all  mw 

Another example on  deal  is a purchase from EES HE  which was also entered as two separate strips of  mw each Again the report read only one of these and I eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of  mw for those hours

Due to the nature of Real Time deal entry  high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling  it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price So Im hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms Please let me know if this is feasible

 REPORT NOT READING SALES AT THE BC BORDER  This is a new one that cropped up this morning We made a purchase from a counterparty at the BPA Busbar wheeled the power to the BC Border and sold it there For some reason although all three deals  appear in Deal Entry and Scheduling the sale at the BC Border does not show up in the Forward Obligation report After looking into this Ive found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal  is simply not pulling into the report Im wondering if this is related to deals done at the BC Border although I dont recall seeing this problem before

Again please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed I look forward to our next conference call

The following is a message that Heather sent to me after we talked about this deal and she did some additional research A synopsis of this deal

Geir entered the deal on   Buy  sell  creating a  per MW charge to your books 
You went back on  and corrected the sel price to  changing the  charge to your books to a  per MW charge to your book
Since this is an intramonth change Portland Risk should recognize this when the compare it to their LiqRec report and they should recognize a  credit back in your PMAs  Since the change was done before monthend this never hit settlements to pull thru for DPR because by the time Settlements looked at it it was correct

My point here is that you WILL see this credit in your PMAs you just havent yet  With the transition of people in Risk one of the functions that got delayed was the trueup between the LiqRec report and the end of the month intramonth changes report which is where your variance is sitting now  Risk is aware that this is out there and they are doing their best to true these types of things up  As of today they are working back to January  Right now they cant give me a timeline of when this will be recognized but please be assured that they are working on it  

Heather has requested that if you have specific questions that you direct them to her  She will also let you know as soon as she has a good idea of when they will be caught up

Please also feel free to ask me any questions about the processes  Ill help you in any way that I can
Thanks for pointing this out to us  Anything that can help us to stay on top of these processes is always a plus

Virginia





Also concerning WBOM 
What happens when a deal is changed in the same month after the flow date  Risk can calculate the difference and add it to the Liquidation value
Or what happens is that we ReRun the reports for Customers and DesktoDesk and Compare to another report called the LiqRec Liquidation Reconcilation the differences we should run through the books  
John is working on that  He is starting in Jan  So you can let Bill know that yes it has not come through yet  and Risk will enter that
I will give him a better timeline of when that will happen when I know

Thanks for all of your help on this Virginia

JonFYI 

Weve added Burke MidColumbia as a new delivery point in Enpower I know some of you have already traded at this point so if you have a record of the deals youve entered it might be a good idea to go back and correct the delivery point to read Burke

KateAccording to BPA we are almost their on Grays The only change is that Enron needs to report the total generator output which as indicated on the prescheduled sheet is Mw One Mw is going to Grays Harbor PUD and we have no responsibility other than to report the total generator output

Ive sent to BPA on a prescheduled basis all the prescheduled so that shouldnt be a issue

The good news is that on Oct  Grays will no longer be our customer and BPA is saying theyll have a automatic system in place to record these numbers automatically by Mid August so hang in there

StacyISO Market Participants
Since Trade Month November  which settled beginning in January 
payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than the
full amount due Scheduling Coordinators SCs in the monthly cash clearing
process  The purpose of this message is to describe the ISOs policies and
procedures in settling the market when defaults occur
As set forth in Section SABP  of the ISO Tariff when payment defaults
occur from SCs that have obligations to the ISOs markets Debtor SCs the
shortfall is to be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them Creditor SCs
based on their outstanding balances The principles that drive how amounts
are settled and defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below
Proportionate allocation of defaults  The total amount of market defaults
is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each
Creditor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount
receivable for the month  SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on
a monthly basis as described below  The intent of the Tariff is to
equitably distribute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net
market receivables for the period
Each month is treated as a whole period  Final and preliminary invoices are
combined when possible see exception conditions below in allocating market
defaults  Cash payments from the market are received in two stages
preliminary and final  At preliminary market payments are distributed
based on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the
preliminary invoices Final invoices serve essentially as trueups to the
preliminary invoices and accordingly payments received at final are
redistributed to the extent possible to achieve trueup allocations for the
whole month considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both
the preliminary and final invoices
Each month is treated as a discrete period  Market defaults are generally
allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being
settled  The exceptions to this rule involve  SCs that are Creditor SCs
in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods
or  Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for
prior months  In the first instance the Creditor SC would not be paid to
the extent of default obligations from prior months  Amounts due to the
Creditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds
would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period In
the second instance the current months payment is carried back and applied
first to the oldest outstanding balance The proceeds would be distributed
to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs unpaid
balances in that month  With respect to the carry back of payments to the
earliest period Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from
different SCs
GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments   GMC is
billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final
invoices each month  In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices
at either preliminary or final market funds are transferred to satisfy
GMC obligations before any market distributions are made  This first
priority position for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP  of
the ISO Tariff  Therefore when both GMC and market defaults occur as has
occurred in each of the past few months the Creditor SCs have two
reductions to the market clearing amounts ultimately paid  an allocated
portion of the GMC default and an allocated portion of the market default
RMR invoices and payments are not affected by market or GMC defaults  The
RMR invoicing process involves amounts due from the PTOs to the RMR Owners
as set forth in monthly invoices processed through the ISOs systems
However such amounts are invoiced independent of the ISOs market and GMC
billing processes and accordingly market andor GMC defaults do not impact
RMR related payments
There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of
allocating cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur  Some of these factors
include
	amounts received after payment date deadlines  such amounts are
typically included in the next distribution
	market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the
current month  such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount
of the GMC default by the Creditor SC
	allocations to prior months  not made unless the amount exceeds
 of that months billed amounts
	small invoices under  are paid in full rather than the
allocated percentage
For more information about these allocation issues or any other related
matters please contact Melodie Iverson   email
mkiversoncaisocom mailtomiversoncaisocom  or Mike Epstein

This Saturday  Frontier needs to repay BPA for Control Area reserves that where used on  and  The total Frontier owes is  Mw Ive arranged with BPA to return  Mw on peak for Saturday

However this payback needs to be done Real Time as BPAs ability to take the energy is dependant on their system operations 

The Real Time procedure is as follows

 Call the BPA Real Time power scheduler at  around  or  and tell him you are calling to schedule energy imbalance paybacks from Frontier Energy for  Mw On Peak If BPA can take the schedule try to get them to commit to take all  hours Then call BPA Real Time transmission and buy a  Mw wheel using account   for Energy Imbalance paybacks to BPA merchant 

If BPA is unable to take the  Mw schedule for any hour please sell it Real Time for the best price in the Northwest 

 In Enpower enter a buy from Frontier at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal Enter a sale to BPA at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal Extend BPA transmission deal  to include the additional  mw

Call me if there are questions or problems We tried to do this payback last Saturday and the energy just went inadvertent for  hours because we didnt call BPA

x Hi Guys

  I was hoping one of you could help me solve a deal
 The following is my understanding of what happened

  On  Wednesday CONAGRA called EPMIs scheduling group about a cut to a dayahead schedule for HE 
  Cara took the call and told Conagra that the cut had to be done RealTime because it was the day of flow
  Cara transferred the call to Real time

  I was wondering if any of you took a call regarding a cut for HE  to one of our schedules going to Conagra it must have been somewhere at the very beginning of your shift  Conagra says they talked to a male real time  
  I find no cut information in the discussion database or in writing and no cuts in EnPower  Unfortunately I cannot check the Lotus Notes Schedule information in the Database because this day is one of the days that is missing  
  Conagra is charging us  LDs for having to resupply themselves  Ive asked them to pull their tapes and tell me who they talked to EPMI Real Time   Just thought Id get the story from our side in the mean time

    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide

PreSchedule	  Managed by Cara Semperger  

Donald Robinson   and Diana Scholtes   will be involved with the prescheduling of Air Products energy

My office phone number is   with a cellular phone number of  

A general rule of thumb would be we preschedule the next days energy by  AM PPT the day prior to delivery except for on Thursday mornings we preschedule Friday and Saturday and on Friday we preschedule Sunday and Monday  Holidays are prescheduled by the specific Holiday but if youll check with us in advance well be able to provide with the preschedule deadline  Air Products is free to make changes at anytime and internally we will get the request to the appropriate person

Thanks again for the opportunity to become Air Products Energy Provider of choice let me know if you have any questions and or concerns

Published Thursday Aug   in the San Jose Mercury News 
Western power grid has close call
Delivery problem could have led to blackouts throughout region 
Stern warning issued to power generators who didnt deliver last week federal investigation urged 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK mailtojwoolfolksjmercurycom AND STEVE JOHNSON mailtosjohnsonsjmercurycom
Mercury News 
The Western power grid serving  million people nearly collapsed a week ago when generators failed to deliver promised electricity  a problem California officials warned Wednesday is occurring with alarming frequency 
Last Thursdays close call could have knocked out power in  states and parts of Canada and Mexico causing the regions worst outages in five years 
Youre standing on the edge of a cliff when a generator fails to do what you order them to do said Jim Detmers vice president of grid operations at the California Independent System Operator Its not just California thats at risk Its the whole Western United States 
The dire warning comes as Californias energy crisis seems to be easing with not one of the predicted blackouts rolling across the state so far this summer 
The intricately balanced system came so close to failure last Thursday that an unexpected outage at just one generator anywhere in the region could have triggered blackouts Detmers said 
Airtraffic analogy 
Detmers likened the problem to airliners ignoring orders from the airtraffic control tower The ISO controls the California grid scheduling delivery of electricity much as control towers schedule airplanes for landings 
Its really no different than if a plane comes into San Francisco International Airport and doesnt follow the rules of the air traffic controller Detmers said We had a near miss on our system You had two planes getting very close 
Although the ISO has seen similar problems as far back as December last weeks event prompted grid managers to fire a stern warning late Wednesday to Californias power generators and to call for federal regulators to investigate 
The warning cited a growing pattern among market participants of untenable acts that include failure to comply with dispatch instructions 
Such system performance threatens the reliability of the Western Interconnection and cannot be tolerated the ISO report said 
Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said he hadnt been notified of the grid managers concerns but after being read language in the report said it was pretty strong stuff coming from the ISO 
Jan SmutnyJones a former ISO official who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association which represents generators said he was unaware of the reported problems but agreed the matter is a serious one 
The issue that the ISO is identifying here I cant recall ever seeing that before SmutnyJones said adding that it is crucial to get to the bottom of what the problem is and fix it quick 
System reliability is important to everybody he said 
Companies not named 
Grid officials would not name the companies involved or say whether they believe the problems resulted from confusion or attempts to manipulate the system to boost market prices The offenders were reported to federal regulators who will make that call Detmers said 
SmutnyJones said the problem may stem from lingering confusion among energy sellers over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions June  order extending price controls throughout the West 
I dont think anybody is deliberately trying to put the system in jeopardy SmutnyJones said There is some confusion and some controversy around 
Grid managers cited two recent examples of problems that are threatening the stability of the system In one case a generator scheduled far more power than it was capable of delivering and fell more than  megawatts short A megawatt is enough to power some  homes or more 
In another case a generator balked at an ISO order to deliver power needed to stabilize the system 
Because electricity must be used as it is produced the grid manager must precisely match power supply with demand throughout the day A mismatch can trigger circuit breakers throughout the system causing widespread blackouts 
The last major failure on the Western grid was on July   when a tree growing too close to a highvoltage line in Idaho sparked outages across the region affecting  million customers 
Managers goal 
Grid managers aim to keep the system running at a frequency of  hertz It normally fluctuates between  and  hertz Detmers said Last Thursday it fell to  hertz 
Blackouts can begin when it gets down to  hertz he said Every loss of  megawatts costs the system  hertz he said 
A substantial drop in frequency can cause widespread outages that can take days to fix he said 
To maintain balance the ISO must keep supply and demand within  megawatts Detmers said Last Thursday the system slipped more than  megawatts out of balance for more than  minutes and was as much as  megawatts off

Embedded Picture MetafileHi Bill

Sorry I havent been alive earlier but its been busy busy here too 

After leaving Portland we went to NY for a few days and we got here in Houston during the weekend of the flood but we were lucky not to get any of that In fact I was suprised when I saw the news the next morning

First thing  I checked my past paychecks and you were correct I have been receiving the  extra for shift work I apologize for bringing it up in our meeting as I did not know anything about it I did not receive any explanation that I was going to get it for shift work and I never check my paychecks in detail anyway  
Thanks for sitting with me in that meeting too I had a good time working in real time  

Work here is fine It is a new market that Enron is exploring that of paper and pulp and trading is fairly thin I do market analysis for pulp traders and it includes intensive newsreading and passing on important info and gathering of the data and compiling spreadsheets creating graphs and so on I like it a lot I take a lot of the reading home  I get to do some travelling too both in the US and overseas and I like that too I like the people in my group and they help me when I dont know stuff One good thing about being here is that there are a lot of classes offered and I am going to be in some of them 

Texas is different for sure but we like it Yes it is hot but I feel like home We have been out a bit and went to Dallas last weekend to visit some cousins There is a lot of spanish around here you hear it everywhere so I decided to learn it  and I am going to start it this week twice a week Its great beacuse when I learn new words I can practice with my latin coworkers

Thats pretty much it for now 

When is evaluation taking place How are things there I bet much busier 

Let me know
cheers
Monika

Heather I have gone through the PMAs and portions of them look appropriate however I would appreciate it if you could look into a couple of deals for me

First
STWHOURLY
Deal  and   When Mark Guzman originally made these deals he neglected to put in a  mw purchase from WWP at  for HE   He also neglected to put in the  mw sale to Wesco at   The PMA shows the cost for the  mw purchase from WWP at  but does not show the revenue from the  mw sale to Wesco at   These changes were put in at the same time on the same day per Virginia  This is approximately 

Deal   David Porter originally put this deal in as a buy from STCALI  The deal should have been a buy from EES  I changed the counterparty only approximately  hours after the flash  The charge of  is the entire charge for the deal  mws at  for HE   If I am charged by EES I believe I should receive revenue from STCALI for the expense that went out with the flash

STWBOM
Deal   Geir Solberg entered a buyresale for  and I corrected this to  and  for a difference of  on   This represents a  change for the better

There may be more but this is all I have for now
Again I appreciate you taking the time to look into these

Thanks

The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the GPSD website at

You will be surprised to learn like I was that we were not promoted to the

division in order to be eligible for the championship

Our first game is on Sunday Sept th at Delta Park  NE of Strasser at
  All of the rest of the games in the  game season will also be at
 and will occur every Sunday between Sept th and November th with
the exception of Sunday October st when we have a bye  We then will have
a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again
Right

Dont forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or are
new to the team  You update or get a player card at the OASA league office
off of Highway  at the Sylvan exit  They do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there

Anyway that is enough from me  See you soon out on the soccer pitch

 Subject America The Beautiful

In the wake of the election fiasco and the national tragedy of today this
is worth reading We still live
in  the greatest country in the world and sometimes we forget what we have
worked so hard for   This from a Canadian newspaper is worth sharing

America The Good Neighbor
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to A
remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a
Canadian television commentator What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record

This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the
most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth
Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out
of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in
billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these
countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the
United States
When France was in danger of collapsing in  it was the Americans who
propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris I was there I saw it
When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries
in to help This spring  American communities were
flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about  the decadent warmongering Americans
Id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the
erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane
Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing
Jumbo Jet the Lockheed TriStar or the Douglas DC
If so why dont they fly them Why do all the International lines except
Russia fly American Planes
Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on
the moon
You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios
You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles
You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon  not
once but several times  and safely home again
You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store
window for everybody to look at
Even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on
our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are
getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here
When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking
Down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned
them an old caboose Both are still broke
I can name you  times when the Americans raced to the help of other
people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced
to the Americans in trouble I dont think there was outside help even
during the San Francisco earthquake
Our neighbors have faced it alone and Im one Canadian who is damned
tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing
with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their
nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope
Canada
is not one of those

	After we convene the Management Committee later this week I will make a further announcement regarding the Executive CommitteeDear STSW Traders

FYI  
There was a cut on deal   on June   for HE   It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from  MW to  MW  Mirant is at fault for the cut our upstream is PAC  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule  the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI Bob at PAC Emily at Mirant and Jackie for WAPA Jackie is a control area dispatcher so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA hence there was no bookout  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now  They do not plan on charging us LDs shes checking with her boss to make sure  We will just reduce the schedules to  for HE 

It is up to you if you want to charge LDs to Mirant for the spread

Just wanted to let you know and get your input

I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts  For the past  month Ive noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower  Accordingly by the end of the day when I have to route it has made my job that much easier  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyones lives better

Keep up the great work guys

KateTwo things 

 Weather Tracking  Did we decide to ask Fundamentals about tracking forecastedtoactual temperatures Or would you me to organize this specifically for Real Time

 BPA Transmission Losses  Would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily weekly or monthly basis For billing purposes and general clarity I think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs ie pay them back in an annuity each day week or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge  too much room for error

Also Darin Presto and Casey Anderson should both have  access to the systems they need but it seems to be an ongoing process so well keep our fingers crossed

Let me know what your thoughts are on these two things

Here is the final letter we sent to DWR regarding the creditworthiness
issue  It will be posted on our website at  just prior to our 
press call

Please let me know if you have any questions

Katie Kaplan
Manager of State Policy Affairs
Independent Energy Producers Association
 After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re unit outages  We need to communicate with  different groups  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk  First we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk  That phone number is   When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call  Services will communicate outages to Real Time

Thanks

Chris  Bill Williams in our real time group is going to handle this  I believe he is in touch with Michael

Thanks

 What is the status for Enron  Are they going to use the RMR client for

Northern California Area and one in Southern California depending on the
number of seats requested  The proposed dates are shown below

This course is designed to familiarize those personnel who will be
responsible for reporting NERC GADS data for the Generating Asset Owner with
the software tools data structure and data rules  It also provides
instruction on how to use the GADS database for running various performance
and statistical reports on your specific units or industry information  A
detailed agenda is attached

The exact location for the training will be firmed up at a later date

California ISO needs to know the numbers of people the Generating Asset
Owners propose to send in order to complete the planning  To that end we
are asking interested parties to respond by August   with the
following information

Subject Rate for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System


Dear Customers

Effective June   the Rocky Mountain Region RMR implemented Rate Schedule LUS for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services copy of rate schedule attached  This rate schedule was posted to RMRs OASIS website under Current Business Practices on August  

During the month of July  RMR began actively researching afterthefact usage of RMRmanaged transmission and identified some unauthorized use of transmission  Some of you have been sent letters concerning perceived unauthorized usage in July  you should receive those letters shortly

RMR has discovered different causes of unauthorized use occurring within WACM and have attached a list outlining some of those causes  This list is by no means a complete listing but rather just whats been seen to date 
A
 s RMR did not post this information publicly until August   we do not feel that we can charge customers for the instances discovered in July but please be advised that from August th forward this charge will apply

Please do not hesitate to call me or Paul Humberson at   if you have questions or would like to discuss  

Lynn Richardson
Public Utilities Specialist
RMR
 Marketing personnel will again be taking call on weekends and holidays
The  extension will be forwarded to EPEs prescheduling personnel and
unit commitment plans will be developed over the weekend

Please call me at  or Pete Serrano at  if questions
arise

Please share this with other personnel as appropriate
  When you buy from the imbalanceServices mw for HE  please make sure that you buy from the correct zoneie  if finals have sp load decd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp  Day shift assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for  hours they decd SP load  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a  for HE   As always we dont want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want

  Unless I have been informed incorrectly we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easierBill

These are currently being tested so all transactions will bridge into our downstream systems correctly  I will let you know as soon as they are ready for use

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight which will be in effect on Monday August   Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website A summary of these changes is listed below

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders  This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the traders stack price Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp When a counterparty trades on a  Top of Stack Entry it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website

In order to turn on this functionality select the  Allowed Top of Stack option in the Orders section of the product properties page  If regular limit order functionality is desired the Allowed  option should be selected

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders  This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the traders stack price Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp When a counterparty trades on a  Top of Stack Entry it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website

In order to turn on this functionality select the  allowed as Restricted Top of Stack option in the Orders section of the product properties page  If regular limit order functionality is desired the Allowed  option should be selected If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the Restricted Top of Stack feature

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab   Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the  All option from the drop down box


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders   The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction while the button on the right will submit as a limit order  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the Todays Orders section The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product Once the price is at the desired level click the Set button and the price will be modified Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order  You will see a box with plus minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to  days Currently they may place orders for only up to  hours

Float the Todays Orders Section
You can now float the  Limit Order  section In order to do so right click in the Todays Orders  section and select the float window option In order to make the window  Stay On Top  right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option

Mid Market Client  Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers while including their desired margin on the trade on EnronOnline products In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price a customised submission window will appear  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list  enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep  at  and you wish to have a  cent margin please enter  as the desired price and  as the margin The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep  is at  book the trade at  and record the  origination amount

In order to be set up to use this functionality Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group

Changes to Website Passwords  As an added security measure which has been requested by many customers some new password rules have been instituted First the password cannot be equal to the login ID Second each user will be prompted to change his password every  days These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August   The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night and external users by the end of the week  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at

BertI have obtained a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below  It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday  Summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC which plan should

prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan

adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs

promote conservation and demand response 

Please see details below




June  
The Honorable Curt H

bert Jr
Chairman
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 First Street NE
Washington DC 

Dear Chairman Hbert

Since last summer the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely
monitored the electricity situation in California  Today the West
continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and
California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again
this summer  After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West
including several hearings in Washington and California we recommend that
the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity
prices and keep power flowing into California

We recognize the Commissions efforts in recent months to address the
electricity crisis in the California and western markets including measures
to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices  While we are
pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout
the West we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale
electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the
entire West in the hot summer months to come  To ensure that prices are
just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the
Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices
in western markets  We strongly urge the Commission to implement a
comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor
wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market
participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC

Specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale
electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the
WSCC  The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and
failures to comply with agreements to sell power  If the Commission finds
that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it
should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the
full extent allowed by law

Aware of the danger of discouraging supply the Commission has relied upon
marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would
exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts  We share
the Commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply
Accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution
the Commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as
appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging
availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission

To mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the
Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote
conservation and demand response throughout the western market  In States
where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less
incentive to conserve  While demand reduction incentives are not a
substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can
encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity
Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both
wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices
foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume
Specifically the Commission should  establish or certify a wholesale
clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and  enable consumers
whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone
power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers
We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand
reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable
sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer  We
understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State
laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant
consumers

We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commissions previous
efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for
consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter  To ensure
maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you
take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as
possible  We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not
later than the close of business on Friday June   If you have questions
please contact our staff  Thank you in advance for your cooperation with
this request

An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor  The Nigerian fraud letter so called because it violates section  of Nigerian law is sent in many variations by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts and for other illegal purposes

If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters forward it to Mike Hicks MichaelHicksenroncom  Corporate Security maintains a file on them and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees

For more information on these letters please email or call Mike at  I have had to change  deals that were entered incorrectly  Just  a reminder


Make sure you put Tacoma in as City of Tacoma Deptof Pub Utilities

NOT  Tacoma Supp

For WSCC Outages and West Realtime databases if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following

Close the database icon

Good Morning

If you are changing any deals that are currently flowing please notify prescheduling of the change and deal number  Small changes can cost us hours of work trying to find a change in balance

The Preschedulers have a distribution list  DLPortland Prescheduling


If you have any questions please see me

CaraFYI 

We will NOT be confirming hourly trades for generators or any other counterparties until further notice The logistics of the process are still being worked out In the meantime keep checking No Confirm on all deals

Bloomberg deals are another story They do get confirmed everyday However the people in the Confirms group know this inherently and do not need the added validation of a Yes Confirm checkmark What they do need is a clue as to which deals have been done with Bloomberg and the best way to convey this is by typing Bloomberg next to the word Broker in your Deal Entry screen

If this is unclear please let me know

The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday There were several IT teams your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audiovideo streaming services

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October  which was set by business Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug  today This didnt provide much time for preparation and testing During the troubleshooting for each of your sites the Network team Scott Shishido and George Nguyen were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance I will be meeting with the Web Edward Ray and Network Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting

THE REAL TIME GROUP MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ON THE PAC TAGS  send the delayed tags out prior to the times indicated on Caras sheet but no sooner than  hrs prior to energy flow    On the pacificorp tags referenced above please call PAC after sending the delayed tags and tell them to kill their tag number Y       Call the ISO to inform them of the tag change and give them the delayed tag numbers    call PSCO and inform them you have submitted the tags  

Please make sure this is happens     If this is not taken care of the schedule wont flow and  Enron will be charged liquidated damages by PacifiCorp  If you have ANY questions regarding these tags or any other tags on Caras list do not hesitate to contact Cara Bill or myself on this matter

  winmaildat FYI 

Roger called today to inform us of a transmission capacity bottleneck at Palo Verde Apparently El Paso cannot take more than  mw into their system at Palo in any given hour therefore we will need to monitor El Pasos net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement If El Paso is taking a net of  mw in at PV youll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee or buy transmission  with SRPPNMTNPAPSetcto fill the lending short Note EPE will still deliver us energy at PV Then enter a zero priced buyresale in Enpower to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV 

This is how it should take place

Due to the recent drop in dayahead prices we have a few counterparties who scheduled less than their Pmax generation  Therefore we need to submit supplemental bids so they will be covered in case the ISO calls on their generation for the difference between the Pmax and their prescheduled generation

Additionally if you can make an SC to SC trade with this generation please do  If you are able to do an SC trade please make sure its for at least a  hour run  Make sure youre in contact with the control rooms to let them know what youre doing  And if you do make an SC to SC trade dont forget to take out the supplemental bids for those hours

So please submit supplemental bids or sell as an SC to SC trade for Harbor Delano Wheelabrator Martel and Sierra Pacific Industries

 Hi Green Roomers

The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the GPSD website at
httpwwwgpsdsoccercom
You will be surprised to learn like I was that we were not promoted to the
st division  It seems that the league has decided to keep us in nd even
though I registered for and said we would accept the promotion to st
division in order to be eligible for the championship    

Our first game is on Sunday Sept th at Delta Park  NE of Strasser at
  All of the rest of the games in the  game season will also be at
 and will occur every Sunday between Sept th and November th with
the exception of Sunday October st when we have a bye  We then will have
a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again
Right

Dont forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or are
new to the team  You update or get a player card at the OASA league office
off of Highway  at the Sylvan exit  They do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there

Anyway that is enough from me  See you soon out on the soccer pitch

Subject FW CAISO Notice  New Requirements Regarding Scheduling And
Dispatch Instructions
Importance High


Greetings

The ISO just released new requirements for scheduling and dispatch
instructions for generators I have attached these requirements for your
convenience

They claim that they had put these requirements in place which are in
effect immediately because people were continually out of compliance with
their and FERCs orders  All of the requirements are extremely
concerning and we should discuss further  One note of interest but not
surprise is that the ISO is inflicting these requirements such as failure
to submit feasible schedules on the generators only claiming their actions
are causing grid instability when in fact failure of the load to properly
schedule and procure for their customers is of graver concern

Other requirements will cause the units to be run harder that needed
further jeopardizing reliability and supporting our arguments made in the
protest

If you think we should discuss further please email me and I will set up a
call

Change is inevitable especially at Enron  Although the announcement of Jeff Skillings resignation is a surprise and generally sad news it is important to remember that our business here in Portland will not be affected by Jeffs departure  Likewise the leadership of Enron Americas and the broader Enron Wholesale Services management team remains unchanged by this announcement  In summary business as usual

                                My Best CraigFired Calif DWR Traders Had Access To ISOs Control Room  Updated Tuesday August    PM ET 
By Bryan Lee 
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
WASHINGTON Dow JonesFour of the five California Department of Water Resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operators control room 
That revelation was contained in a recent letter to the House Government Reform Committee from Terry Winter the California Independent System Operators president and chief executive 
The letter responded to House lawmakers concerns voiced during an Aug  hearing about DWR power traders having access to the ISOs control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there 
Rep Doug Ose RCalif who chairs the committees energy policy panel said access to the ISOs control room allowed DWR traders to cherrypick power purchases and led federal regulators to exclude DWR purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order 
The five fired DWR traders owned stock in Calpine Corp CPN investmentsquotessymbolCPN news investmentsnewssymbolCPN msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolCPN a major power provider in California 
The four fired DWR employees with access to the ISO control room were William Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Chung The fifth Richard Ferreiro wasnt among those Winter listed as having controlroom access Neither did Elaine Griffin who resigned after it was learned she owned Calpine stock 
They were among  DWR employees who had their controlroom access privileges terminated by the ISO over the past two months The others had their badges deactivated because they either hadnt filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadnt been using their badges to access the ISO control room said Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman 
Nine DWR power traders still enjoy access to the ISO control room according to Winters letter to Ose Among them is Bernard Barretto who reportedly owns stock in Enron Corp ENE investmentsquotessymbolENE news investmentsnewssymbolENE msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolENE 
Steve Maviglio a spokesman for California Gov Gray Davis who recently sold Calpine stock after conflictofinterest concerns were raised said earlier this month that Barrettos investment met state ethics rules because Enron wasnt making sales in the spot market where the DWR employee was involved in making power purchases 
DWR employees investments are thoroughly reviewed to make sure there are no conflicts DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests Hidalgo said 
An Ose spokesman Yier Shi said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of California consumers 
Its pretty obvious that it isnt in the interest of California consumers the DWR or the ISO to have that conflict of interest in the powerpurchasing process Shi said 
Why is DWR getting preferential access Thats the core issue Shi added 
Allowing DWR power traders into the ISO control room is a real conflict because DWR is the major buyer in the state said Lynne Church president of the Electric Power Supply Association whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in California 
Having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorterterm markets are charging including whats being sold and to whom Church said 
Any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access she said noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access Its just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence 
During the Aug  hearing that Ose chaired Winter agreed that having DWR employees in the control room was a problem The ISO is working very hard to get them out he said 
The access was provided back in January after the DWR was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about  billion in power on behalf of the states bankrupt and nearbankrupt investorowned utilities Pacific Gas  Electric Co PCG investmentsquotessymbolPCG news investmentsnewssymbolPCG msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolPCG and Southern California Edison Co EIX investmentsquotessymbolEIX news investmentsnewssymbolEIX msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolEIX 
Power providers were balking at continuing to sell power to California unless they were assured of creditworthy buyers And the DWR refused to take on the responsibility unless the ISO granted the agency access to the control room Winter told Oses subcommittee 
The arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts he said 
The DWR will withdraw its employees from the ISO control room effective Sept  Pete Garris who oversees power purchases for the DWR announced over the weekend 
It wasnt our intent to be there on a permanent basis said Hidalgo the DWR spokesman who described the privilege as a temporary move to keep the lights on 
Now that the states electricity crisis has lessened the DWRs goal is to have the traders out of the ISO control room by Sept  Hidalgo said 
Were pleased to see that the DWR is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the ISO said Shi the Ose aide We hope this change of policy isnt too little too late for California consumers to win refunds

Guys please make sure to stay in touch with Jim Reyes on a daily basis to ensure that we are keeping a net payable position with the ISO for the month   Between these congestion relief efforts and EES AS self procurements efforts We dont want to end up in a net receivable position at the end of the month  At this point I think that we are underestimating expenses  Im not sure how much  Im sure based on the amount of load and an average cost per MWH we can determine what our average expense position should be and that should be the room we have to play with each day  month

Im not saying stop your efforts Im just saying we need to stay on top of the overall Net cumulative position for the month

If you have any questions please let myself or Scott Gilbert know

SubjectWhite House To Support FERC Action Today

According to this mornings Washington Post the Bush Administration will s
upport the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California 
price mitigation regime to  other Western states and to all daysall hour
s not just during California emergencies stages   and   This action
 comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the Fein
steinSmith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee Gov 
Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ
ee on Wednesday and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray 
with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday  The latter
 committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy p
olicy on a number of factors including its jurisdiction over presidential 
economic emergency powers  The committee staff has in the past expressed i
nterest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and ma
rkets  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will 
be on Wednesdays agenda

Jon To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias powerbuying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer


ChaosInexperience Hobbled Power Buyers
State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders
By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L RABIN
Times Staff Writers

August  

It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis when Californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka

Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening trying to figure how to keep the lights on when a speeding tractortrailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train

I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising said Ray Hart head of the energy planning team The symbolism was not lost on him

The next day with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West purchasing electricity for  million customers whose utilities were going broke

Now seven months and billions of dollars later the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry Even Gov Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch

Its like the Yankees playing a stickball team he said in a recent interview Were totally out of our league

The administrations new longterm contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future

Making matters worse nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companiesa fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements Five were hastily fired and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations

How an agency could forget conflictofinterest codes or ignore them is beyond me said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica This is the way people lose faith in government

Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in including one from Davis Republican political rival Secretary of State Bill Jones

Amid all the controversy of recent days Hart said the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed

Frankly said Hart a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be getting

Patching Together a Team on the Fly

The states new energybuying organization was a beg borrow and recruit operation A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project

The agency received an immediate infusion of  million to create its expanded trading arm of  employees and consultants

On the fly Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas  Electric Southern California Edison and the energy industry

Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand

From the start the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms

Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day a state budget document said It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively Professionals in this business are highly compensated

Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February

They said Can you be up here Tuesday  said Mead a yearold former Edison engineer from Duarte I said For a job interview And they said No bring enough stuff for several months 

They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume Mead said He worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to sign

In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage  on the verge of blackouts he said There was no focus other than to keep the lights on One day Mead said he bought  of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his hour shift

But unlike Mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes Most worked at the nowdefunct California Power Exchange an energy trading floor similar to a stock market reconciling sales and purchases made by others Before that one worked at a freightforwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia

Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group

Theyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast said Mark Palmer spokesman for Houstonbased Enron Corp one of the nations largest energy marketers Its like someone who flies a kite one day and then is told to go fly a  the next

One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings You dont just come out to someone and say Whats your price and then pay it But thats what some of them have done

A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them

Palmer said California for the salaries its paying could have done better

A particular lightning rod for criticism is the  twoyear contract of chief trader Susan T Lee  who was hired in April for  an hour

With barely a years experience in the energy industry she leads a person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use State records show that Lee was paid more than  a month including overtime as she began her new duties

That ladys got one years experience and shes getting  grand Palmer said An experienced trader in private industry he said might make  to  in a good year plus bonuses

Shes certainly making double what I am but shes worth it said Hart who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the onceobscure Department of Water Resources

Although Lee could not be reached for comment Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market California energy deregulation began only in  and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year he said I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experience

Lees team members meanwhile have been signed to lucrative shortterm contracts worth a maximum of  to  a month including housing rental cars per diem pay and flights home on days off State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount

One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didnt think they were qualified

Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete

They know more than me theyve seen it all said state trader Bernard Barretto a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 

In their own defense the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost

Our job was to buy whatever we could buy former trader Elaine Griffin said California was truly a captive market

Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higherups

Do the traders go out and start the deal Yes Hart said Do they cut the final deal No

Far from the trading trenches the governor sees things differently The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources he said

These are very sophisticated operations Davis said They have several meteorologists and banks of media people

To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias powerbuying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer

The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills

Some traders however saw through the guise The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tipoff that California had weighed in

I knew it and Im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it too said one trader who like others asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state But it worked for a while It helped keep the shortterm prices down

Controversy Over Stock Holdings

The state traders were powerless however to protect themselves

Just as they were settling into their new jobs and energy prices were falling the administration was stung by the disclosures that  of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired

Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firmSan Josebased Calpine Corpin which they had owned stock

The highestranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira who was hired on a  contract in January to negotiate longterm power contracts

The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng Elaine Griffin who had resigned just days before the firings also held Calpine stock while trading for the state

Most of the traders who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares

Mead said traders on his state teamsuch as Cheng Leung and Louiehad no ability to influence Calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and small

Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it He said his investments of  in  and  last fall brought him about  when he was ordered to sell last month

You want to know how I picked Calpine he said Investors Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential

Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his  worth of shares on Jan  while still at the Power Exchange which had a conflictofinterest policy barring ownership of energy stock

I didnt know I would have an opportunity like this at the time Leung said of his briefly held state job I bought it just because Im interested in the market all the time I follow it

Today shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis

They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings

The big boys the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention Mead said Theyre the ones who knew how things worked

Hi Jake and the rest of you

Beautiful open field nets and no one to kick it around with  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at   I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brads team would be there  Not sure what
happened I guess Brads Team either took the week off  moved or changed
times If any one sees him ask what is going on I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service I also went over to
Madison High on th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
email regarding practice  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night  to  at Oregon Episcopal School
OES to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks  Is that still ok Justin or Adam   Let us know  Sorry about the no

Ive just spent an hour on the phone with IT in Houston regarding the email I sent out this morning re John Andersons application access Both Leola and Shari at the IT Central desk wherever emails go when you send them from the erequest website confirmed that they were able to login as John Casey Anderson and more importantly were able to login to Enpower Interestingly enough Casey has yet to avail himself of the wonders of the Enpower application here in Portland I have also tried logging on as janders and I do in fact see a link to Enpower in the Start menu under Business Applications however it tells me this link has been moved or removed  

Shari told me there was nothing more she could do for me if Im not seeing the same links that she is so at this point Im going to call on your expertise one more time and hope that we can solve this together

Beautiful open field nets and no one to kick it around with  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at   I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brads team would be there  Not sure what
happened I guess Brads Team either took the week off  moved or changed
times If any one sees him ask what is going on I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service I also went over to
Madison High on th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was

Bill

  As we have been back and forth for  months now there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPCs numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues however there are  discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers I have filled out tape requests for these   Please keep in mind though that we do not have access to these tapesand have not had since April These requests will go to Tim

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the pass thru especially since we have already checked out with them
  Only one dispute a pricing issue could potentially leave us with a negative  DPR

  I need you to make the call today  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done

  If I dont hear from you by tomorrow morning Ill adjust our system according to MPCs numbers until I do

ShortHistory
In case you havent heard our project to implement a highbandwidth connection between Houston  Portland and remove our dependence on Terminal Server is a failure  To make a long story short the new DS allowed more data to travel back and forth but the time to get data between Houston and Portland was  times slower than running it through terminal server 

Plan B ThinClient
So where do we go from here  We are now starting a process to rearchitect our trading applications so that they will run just as fast over our WAN as they do through terminal server  We will be using an architecture that minimizes the traffic over the WAN utilizes specialized servers to do most of the processing and implementing more backend power  To help us in the effort we need your help to identify which applications should be converted first

Good Candidates for Conversion
Listed below are some attributes for applications well suited for the initial architecture conversion
  Runs flaky in Terminal Server Access Violation errors application locksup etc
  Applications primary source of data is located in Houston 
  Mission Critical time constrained applications
  Mission Critical poor performing applications
  Heavily utilized applications

Please reply back to the email or stopby if you have any thoughts on which applications you think should be converted in the firstwave

Amy million profit from the West is not much to show for all of the sleeving Sempra did for the ISO

Sempras trading unit generates a windfall
 
By Craig D Rose 
STAFF WRITER 
July   

Sempra Energy the parent company of SDGE reported a  percent surge in profit to  million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a longterm contract to California 
On the other hand Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit a middleman that earned  million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others 
The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets 
The surprising announcement  that a company lost money selling power during Californias runup in electricity prices  was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the longterm contract it signed with the state to provide power 
Stephen Baum chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the year deal 
California sought longterm electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and nearterm power markets where prices reached record levels 
Critics say Gov Gray Davis rushed into longterm deals because of concerns about getting through next years election They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years 
The governor has acknowledged that longterm contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy 
Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governors proposal to help San Diego Gas  Electric Co clear a debt of  million 
SDGE says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers 
In a media conference last month Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers who he said might have faced the socalled balancing account debt as early as next year 
Shames says the proposal which took the form of a memorandum of understanding or MOU is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra 
He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers 
Shames said he will release an analysis of the states Sempra plan next week The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August 
A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the  million debt Doug Kline the Sempra spokesman said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in midJune 
Sempra Energy Trading meanwhile said only  percent of its  million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region which includes California The trading operation earned  million in profit during the comparable period last year 
Californias Independent System Operator which manages most of the state power grid and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis 
Though Sempra earned money on trading its wholesale power generating business lost  million during the quarter Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed 
Sempra Energy Resources which coowns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy earned  million during the second quarter last year 
Baum added that Sempras longterm contract with the state  under which it will provide up to  megawatts  has allowed its wholesale business to presell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant which will be expanded and three generating facilities it expects to build 
Profits at SDGE slipped to  million during the quarter ended June  down from  million last year according to Sempra SDGE whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity said it provided increased customer service during the crisis which lowered profits 
Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempras results noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by  
Theyre really two years ahead of schedule for their nonutility businesses said Brian Youngberg an analyst with Edward Jones  Co 
Bud Leedom a San Diegobased analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper said Sempras move into energy trading now seems shrewd We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this Leedom said 
Investors pushed Sempra shares up  cents yesterday to close at  in trading on The New York Stock Exchange

I do not know the salary range for this position  but would expect it to be near entry level  This may be a bit of a nip to John Adams  but as both Bill and I have been talking to him about for a year or so now  Enron is a great place to work training is top shelf  we have good people and need more good people to keep our edge  Who knows what his career could go to in a few years John has extensive background in pulp and paper and could end up in that trading floor someday

John is a Graduate of the Naval Academy  former A pilot a great golfer and all the rest and more importantly  has a very good work ethic

Let me know what you think

Bill W the Elder

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From John Lavorato  Dave Delainey

To All of ENA and EES

Re ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enrons reputation in the market place  It is also important that the right product solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron

Consistent with the past EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES

ENA SIC Codes

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals  except for pharmaceutical biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers

IMPORTANT NOTICE
Revised ISO Charge Matrix  Statement File Specification V 

In compliance with recent FERC Order dated  ISO will make implement
changes in its Settlement System to support the following

	Credit Risk Adder and
	Emissions  StartUp Cost Recovery

Credit Risk Adder
The FERC Order put in place a price mitigation scheme for the energy markets
in the western United States  It also directed ISO to add  to Market
Clearing Prices MCPspaid to generators for all prospective sales in its
market to reflect credit uncertainty  The Credit Risk Adder is only used
for settlement purposes  The ISO Scheduling System will continue to
determine MCPs using existing algorithms and the MCPs published in ISOs
OASIS will also reflect the unadjusted MCPs  During the settlement
calculations ISO will increase the following MCPs by 
	Dayahead and Hourahead MCPs for Ancillary Services AS and
	MCP for Real Time incremental energy

The adder raises the MCPs but does not affect the underlying settlement
formulation  The only change made to the Settlement Files is the inclusion
of a new data field for the unadjusted MCP

Emissions and StartUp Cost Recovery
The FERC Order also directed ISO to exclude emissions and startup fuel
costs from the calculation of ISOs mitigated Market Clearing Prices
Generators can invoice ISO for such costs incurred as a direct result of ISO
dispatch actions  ISO will implement two new charges
	Charge Type   Emissions Cost Recovery and
	Charge Type   StartUp Cost Recovery

These new charges serve as a mechanism for ISO to collect funds which will
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators invoices  A rate will be
established by ISO for each charge  For Emissions Cost Recovery the rate
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs
incurred by Mustoffer Generators as a direct result of ISO dispatch
instructions adjusted for interest as may accrue in the Emissions Cost
Trust Account divided by the sum of the forecasted instate load served by
the ISOs transmission system  For StartUp Cost Recovery the rate will be
determined similarly  It will equal that of the forecasted annual total of
all startup costs incurred by Mustoffer Generators as a direct result of
ISO dispatch instructions adjusted for interest as may accrue in the
StartUp Cost Trust Account divided by the sum of the forecasted instate
load served by the ISOs transmission system  ISO plans to publish these
rates shortly  The rates may be adjusted monthly based on ISOs latest
forecast

Both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the Scheduling
Coordinators Settlement Statement for the last day of the trade month
Detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the Scheduling Coordinator on a
given day will be provided in the statement for that day  

Implementation Timeline
The Credit Risk Adder and the new Emission  StartUp Cost Recovery scheme
went into effect on trade date   The statements for  will be
issued on

Hello all

Considering the circumstances if we dont move up I think we should just
move
up to the first division As a lover of european soccer I enjoy the
promotionrelegation system It is a great way for leagues to equalize
competition So we should just take it in the gut and toughin up and move
to
the st Itll be fun and competitive Maybe itll give us more motivation
to
stay focused as a team Im all for it Afterall we deserve it We earned
this
move I dont want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to stay in
nd
Div

But this does mean that it wouldnt hurt to have a few more good players
join
us So if you know of anyone really good have him join

Hi Guys

Just a quick reminder that I do need to get a  from all of you who want
to play on the Green Rooms Fall  Soccer Team     The money  nd
Division or  for st Division is due to the league by July rd so I
need  you to send me a check ASAP  My address is  SW Dakota Drive
Tualatin OR  The  games will be on Sundays from   mostly some
 games starting on September th

The other issue I need you to ponder is st Division vs nd Division  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship for  years if we are st or nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to st division  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager nay volunteers and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in nd or move up to st  Also send me
money  Thanks

We are  mws long HE  at palo verde in the realtime position manager  I printed a forward obligation report for the th and that report does not reflect this length  After checking every deal at PV for the th against the forward obligation report it appears that our deals have been entered correctly   I discussed this with Holden and he agrees there is no reason we should be long at PV for that day  Therefore the correct position at PV for the th is flat  The length is false  If you are aware of any deals that may have caused the realtime position manager to reflect this length please let me know

stacyrunswickenroncom	This is a reminder that the Summer  ISO Demand Relief Program
charges are reflected on the June  statements and June invoices  As
announced previously this year the ISO has developed a Summer  Demand

level of demand reduction on the ISO system that can be implemented during a
stage  Emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a Stage  Emergency  

	Similar to last years program the same charge types are utilized
for capacity Charge Type  and  described in the first link below  Two
new Charge Types  and   have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail described
in the second link below  Although the program was initiated in June no
calls were made to curtail load therefore charges  and  were not
utilized    The periods in which the Demand Relief Program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link

 Scott
 	This is from a guy on our floor  Hes a summer internand this is
 his Tuesday morning story  Incidentally I was standing directly in front
 of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell
 broke loose  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the
 kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher  Didnt find one and like Scott
 the intern was a bit disappointed in my reactionsah well



 I dont usually send out a group email but listen to this shit  So I am
 sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks
 loose  It is about am and most of the trading has subsided for the
 morning  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women
 that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the
 food will lasttoday is a special day because we get a fresh cooked
 breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that
 we are used to because no one wants to get up at am and cook a fresh
 breakfast for Enron employees they usually cook it the night before So
 everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility
 of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the
 afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green
 eggs  So I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 
 yearold women at the grill  Everyone is smiling deciding whether or not
 they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something
 The next thing you know straight out of a FOX tv show or Youve Gotta
 See This episodethis old woman is engulfed in flames like the great
 fire of Chicago  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the
 flames are high and wide raising up to ten feet in height  The place
 turns into a frenzy Nobody can move react or anything  Everyone is
 frozen watching this old womanpicture happy Gilmores grandma go up like
 an old Christmas tree  A few seconds before this high school chemistry
 experiment I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was
 staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the
 sports ticker on ESPN on the inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly
 above my desk The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of
 me about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno
 along with a coworker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the
 flames I dont save the old woman like most of you might have thought I
 cant do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going
 to jump in there and save this poor lady  The old woman is yelling
 Somebody get me outta hereyet we all continue to starefinally
 someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze  Who is this masked
 man I have no clue  However I do witness Les from middle marketing
 doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which
 he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is I see
 someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier which is
 funny if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair
 and her arms are about to blister up  The blaze is extinguished after
 taking a hell of a toll on the old woman ruining the flat screen tv that
 used to sit above me and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of
 computer screens  The alarm in our building  World Trade Center is
 screaming and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area
 So the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building
 and on her way to the hospital  Who knows what condition she is in but
 all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginasmyself and the
 rest of us that did nothing when I go up in flames someday  Well I have
 to get back to work because I have wasted about  minutes writing this
 drama  Take care Scotty

  CDTF Blackouts dont justify takeout Connell says 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
Published July   
While operating in crisis mode Department of Water Resources staff worked hour days slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep Californias lights on 
Saying the department charged enough to feed a small army state Controller Kathleen Connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about  for department food purchases in January 
We are not going to be paying these bills Connell told reporters Tuesday 
The state does not buy businesshour meals for staff while they are in town Connell said Additionally the use of a governmentissued credit card to make the purchases was improper she said If the department does not require the employees to pay for the takeout meals she said the department will have to absorb the cost 
The Department of Water Resources began scrambling to buy power Jan  after Gov Gray Davis declared a state of emergency  the same day Northern California was hit with rolling power blackouts As a result of the departments new responsibility staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock said Oscar Hidalgo a department spokesman 
Buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm Hidalgo said 
Under emergencies such as these  we believe we were in a position to do this Our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood Hidalgo said 
Californias recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forget the level of crisis the state was in Hidalgo said It seems at every turn  people are making Monday morning quarterback calls he said 
Connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze 
They said using the CalCard for buying food is specifically prohibited Its not an open line of credit she said

	Ose puts the blame where it belongs by pointing out that the ISOs favoritism towards DWR cost California billions in potential refunds


ISOs role in sales is rapped Critics challenge the independence of the power grid operator
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
Published Aug   
WASHINGTON  The independence of Californias power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state Department of Water Resources came under fire at a House of Representatives hearing Thursday 
But grid operators said there was no way that armslength transactions with the Department of Water Resources could have been negotiated beginning in January when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money 
Rep Doug Ose RSacramento chairman of the House Governmental Affairs energy policy panel charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the DWR and the California Independent System Operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators 
The states interference into CalISO has possibly cost Californians billions of dollars in potential refunds Ose said Moreover it represents a serious violation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions regulations 
At issue is the fact that the ISO is run by a fiveperson board appointed by the governor when under federal law it is supposed to be independent Additionally the ISOs biggest customer is the DWR which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cashstarved to buy it themselves 
Last week the FERC determined that the DWR would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts In reaching that decision the commission cited the agencys special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers 
Terry M Winter ISO president and chief executive officer said that at the time the Department of Water Resources began buying power in January under these unusual circumstances there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses 
That occurred because the market was not functioning Winter said They were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power 
But Kevin Madden the regulatory commissions top lawyer said the relationship between the ISO and the Department of Water Resources raises troubling questions 
DWR buying on behalf of the state is a market participant he said It shouldnt be in the ISO control room It shouldnt be allowed to cherry pick among power sellers 
Madden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the ISO should be reconstituted to ensure its independence

  I have the following charges on BPAs revised final bills and was wondering if you could tell me whos books these should go on


  October 	   
  February     

  I spoke with Corrine Surface at BPA and learned that these charges are being applied given the following situation

  On October   and February   and   our RealTime group called BPA to reserve transmission for some schedules  Our RT guys requested tranny using account numbers such as  that were for dayahead firm transmission thus entering the field of Unauthorized Increase Charges incurred at MWh   Since BPA did not go over the structure of the product in that account they are not going to charge us the  per MWh but since we did get firm transmission we will have to pay the Mwh for the firm hence the above charges

  I understand that you have also spoken with Corrine at BPA and were going to talk to Bill  Can you let me know where these charges need to go 

  Bill  Diana is out this week so if you have already talked to her about this please let me know

Hi Guys

I still have not confirmed anything with the old Biddys team so I suggest
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as I do
Check out the scrimmage Keith found at the Washington Park soccer field on
Sunday at   He says its open and ok for us to take part The field is
close to but South of the Rose Garden Trolley Station and closest too but
down hill from the kids playground  To get there from the Rose Garden take
the Road to the left which brings you back into SW Portland  Hope to see
you there

the number I have for him is no longer in service I also went over to
Madison High on th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was

I know that the hourly traders are not in the habit of making sure that these energy types are correct but if we are going to confirm these they need to make an effort to do so  Will you please forward this to them and make sure that all of them are aware how important this will be for documentation purposes

FYI  The report is attached

NGIs Daily Gas Price Index 
published  August  



CAEM Study Gas Dereg Has Saved Consumers B 


Nearly  years of competition in the natural gas market has reduced national energy costs by more than  billion according to a new study issued Monday 

This amounts to perhousehold savings of  as a result of gas deregulation which began in the late s with the phased removal of wellhead price ceilings then graduated to lighterhanded regulation of interstate pipelines and now is focusing on opening up the distribution end according to the study commissioned by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets CAEM a nonprofit thinktank in Washington DC 

The nearly  years of competition weve experienced in the natural gas industry proves that the right conditions can foster lower costs for consumers and motivate the industry to make investments that benefit the environment our economy and our national security said CAEM CEO Ken Malloy 

In addition to the cost savings to the public the study credits deregulation for the rise in the number of gas suppliers at the wholesale and retail levels a reduction in longterm price fluctuations although it has triggered more shortterm price volatility greater focus on energyefficient purchases by customers making gas the fuel of choice for many and industry improvements in how its buys sells and trades gas supplies In addition it noted that lighthanded regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers 

In short the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the s and early s were wrong by a long shot according to CAEM 

What we also need to recognize is that weve witnessed a redistribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our national security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil said Malloy who formerly was on the staff at FERC and the US Energy Department 

The study entitled California Here We Come The Lessons Learned from Natural Gas Deregulation offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state  put the right regulatory framework in place half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing  dont expect results overnight stay the course  markets do work and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform  the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits and  organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers

StewartEveryone

This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought  I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention

  According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff  The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions

  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first  CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section  d  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy  If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as   Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR  

  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as   Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it

  While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis  Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts  Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO

  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of  expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to   These SCs are in for a big surprise  According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy  Where is the price mitigation here

  Who benefits under this scam  Davis and CDWR  Who loses under this scam  Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy

  Sources  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also

  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito

There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say  but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait  days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets

Market in Charge Type  are determined by CERS and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases and  pricingcharges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to

	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling   Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged   is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh  is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO  His response was this  that the CAISO is charging  regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS  In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS

During our monthend processes I have researched deal   The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE   Originally the deal liquidated with HE MWh HEMWh  and HE MWh but on  the volume for HE was zeroed out in scheduling which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE back

I have one question on this months PMA and some questions from last month  First for deal  this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  Are we being charged for each counterparty again like EES and STCali last month if so we need to fix this flawed tool 

Second for last month we determined that the WBOM book needs a  PMA for change in price  The appropriate price is in Enpower but the revenue has never appeared Deal  Remember this deal was originally input as a buy at  and a sell at  and liquidated at these prices The deal is now at  and   What do we need to do to get this trued up
Please come see me with questions

  As we have been back and forth for  months now there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPCs numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues however there are  discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers I have filled out tape requests for these   Please keep in mind though that we do not have access to these tapesand have not had since April These requests will go to Tim

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the pass thru especially since we have already checked out with them
  Only one dispute a pricing issue could potentially leave us with a negative  DPR

  I need you to make the call today  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done

  If I dont hear from you by tomorrow morning Ill adjust our system according to MPCs numbers until I do

  Thanks

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago most of our ADS cards have expired  We were then using Brett Hunsuckers card  If you remember we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago  Unfortunately Bretts card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO  Is there something that I can do to speed this process perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords  All your help is appreciated

Thanks

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston Amy Clemons and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out  She said that would accomplish the same thing

Pete is out of the office until Monday but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this

		Energy Exchange Program Neutrality Adjustment
		Charge Type 
		SC Settlement Contacts

		Background
		As you may know the Energy Exchange Program began on trade
date   In this program the ISO obtained needed energy in the real
time market and rather than paying for the energy as a purchase later
returned the energy in another period  This was not necessarily a
oneforone exchange  The incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued  Since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the ISO The ISO created Charge Type  for
the allocation of the cost to SCs participating in the market during the
incoming schedules

		Notification
		The ISO has created Charge Type  so that whenever an
Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the SCs based on their total
negative Uninstructed Energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place  This new Charge Type will appear beginning on the
June   statements which will be published on August    In
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as December 
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data

		CT  is a semi automated charge meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated but it will be a manual charge type
within the Manual Line Item Records and will not require a change to your
settlement system  Note that this charge will not appear on every
statement but only when an Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance

 There will be no deals on the ST W Hourly books
 ST NW will show only PGE purchase deal   offset by SWAP between ST NW and LT NW
 All other deals      and  have been changed to the LT NW book

According to this article Morgan Stanley now controls about onethird of the Southern Interties total northbound capacity or about  megawatts until February   Then its share drops to just over  megawatts until March sch 


Wall Street joins the energy players 
By Les Blumenthal 
Bee Washington Bureau 
Published June   
WASHINGTON  Wall Streets interest in the West Coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some Manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for muchneeded generating plants 
Morgan Stanley which earned more than  billion last year has quietly purchased a major share of one of the Bonneville Power Administrations huge transmission lines that link California with the Pacific Northwest 
The  million deal caught Bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on Capitol Hill Morgan Stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the socalled intertie to ship power purchased in the Southwest for sale to utilities in Washington state and Oregon 
Although most of the attention in the Western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from Texas and other Southern states Morgan Stanley ranks among the  largest power marketers in the nation according to reports filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Morgan Stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in  the first Wall Street firm to take such a step 
Merrill Lynch also is registered with the commission 
Wall Street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities including energy said Judy Hitchen a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New York 
But many in the utility industry said they hadnt realized Morgan Stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading 
I wasnt aware of it Mark Crisson superintendent of Tacoma Power said of Morgan Stanleys purchase of capacity on the intertie It shows how things are changing 
And in Congress Rep Peter DeFazio DOre said Morgan Stanleys direct involvement in West Coast electricity markets wasnt all that surprising 
Its wonderfully lucrative for a few folks DeFazio said This is the big new game Its the new world of deregulated energy 
Bonneville has four major transmission lines linking California and the Northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of Seattle The lines were built by the federal government are operated by the transmission arm of BPA and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that Bonneville could hog the regions power grid 
Morgan Stanley now controls about onethird of the lines total northbound capacity or about  megawatts until February  
Then its share drops to just over  megawatts until March  BPA and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity 
They sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date said Shepard Buchanan a spokesman for BPAs transmission side No one had ever made a longterm purchase of that transmission path before It had never come up before 
Under federal regulation BPA had no choice but to accept the Morgan Stanley bid 
The transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand Though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market 
Buchanan said Bonneville would be keeping a close watch on Morgan Stanley 
We are concerned he said We dont want anyone gaming the market by controlling the transmission system We will keep a close eye on Morgan Stanley and others 
Although not a secret the deal was finalized in early January and since then has been accompanied by little public notice 
We purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations Hitchen said in response to written questions 
Morgan Stanleys Internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing 
Commodity trading revenues rose  percent to a record level in fiscal  primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energyrelated products including electricity natural gas and crude oil the companys annual report said Increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products relatively low inventory and reduced production values 
Morgan Stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the intertie it doesnt use to other power marketers federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales 
We have also offered capacity for resale to third parties Hitchen said 
Others remain skeptical 
Bonnevilles powermarketing arm also has expressed unease with the Morgan Stanley contract 
Bonneville sells about  percent of the wholesale electricity in the Northwest most of it lowcost hydropower generated at the  federal dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers It also controls about  percent of the regions electric transmission grid 
Crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants 
It doesnt surprise me a lot that they are marketing power he said They are capitalists But they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities

There is a chocolate almond roca with chocolate ganache cake up for all to share
HI there stranger

Well I havent spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and Im just
checkin to see that my lil buddy in Portland isnt working himself too
hard  As you know I tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a
workout and a scrimmage soccer game  I am so sore  Its out of control

Ok so down to the REAL reason Im writing  Brendan and I had a great time
at Happy Hour  We talked a little about you but mostly about life in
general  He had mentioned that he had Emailed me so I rushed home to check
it

Basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as
odd  I guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt
He had written that although you thought I was cool and whatever you had
commented on how strange  the situation was and he sort of elaborated on
that

So the point of this Email is I guess to reassure you that I only have the
best intentions towards you  I am not trying to be your girlfriend or
anything similar to that  To tell you the truth I dont even know what your
romantic situation is  I just think you are an awesome guy whom Id love
to become close friends with

 I am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in Huntington Beach if you
still are and Im thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together  I
bragged and bragged to Brendan about what a great guy you were and then came
home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances  I really am
just a very overly affectionate and loving person not to mention
spontaneous  I didnt mean to scare you away from having a great
friendship with me and me with you

For heavens sake you are my Portland connection and Im your beach bum
buddy  Honestly if I were a psycho I would have jumped at the chance to
come up and see your condo when you offered  I just think you are someone
Id love to get to know  Especially if you are anything like Brendan which
best friends usually are he is such a sweetie  When he and Meg go to visit
her mom in LA they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are
welcome to stay with me as well

I guess I never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to
be quite honest I didnt even think to ask Brendan because its not
important  I want you Bill for your friendship and for your companionship
now and when I move to Portland  Reflecting back I realize that I may have
written or said something that caught you off guard  Its just my
personality  Im a huge flirt  For heavens sake I was voted Most
flirtatious my senior year not to mention Most likely to succeed
Probably the second one due to the first but who knows  Hahaha  Im only
teasing

Ok seriously now Bill I want you to be honest  If I did locating your
condo etc or said like that was the most romantic thing I had ever read
that was written by a guy something to upset you or give you a false
impression I am so sorry I do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived
in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter I knew
your romantic stiuation yeah I would have jumped at the chance to have
dated you  But we didnt and the truth is I can never have too many
friends  Especially good looking ones that I can introduce to all my girl
friends so that they can be jealous with envy 

Like I said I only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our
relationship as friends  But if you are uncomfortable with something Ive
done or said I am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or Email
me and youll never hear from me again  Scouts honor  I ve never been a
scout but Im not know for my lies either Teehee

I would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our
realtionship as friends  If I can Ill put your mind at ease if not well I
enjoyed our short  minute interlude  As always you are still welcome to
come visit me and stay with me I would love to have the company

If I dont hear form you within the next couple of weeks Ill assume the
worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you
change your mind  Im lucky in the fact that I can do that sort of thing
  Ok just Email me or call me  Let me know that you are alive and
kickin

 Ill be leaving for Calgary Canada this Thursday morning at  am and will
be there until the th  Im so excited this is my first trip out of
country but then again you know that  So I guess Ill hear from you when I
hear from you

I just thought of a last possible reason I may be way off base here but I
am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself  He
is a real sweetheart and hes going to make a wonderful husband and
father just not with me  If you are concerned about our friendship and
him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and Todd is
secure enough in himself that he doesnt care  If this is about August and
you staying with me my father is moving me down not him and it will be a
long time until he can come to visit  Also when I get there we are not
going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship  I havent dated
or had much of a wild stage and I have told him that we will see other
people  Hes fine with that as well

Ok I admit that his Potland stunt was a little irrational but hey I thought
it was thoughtful and darling  I love surprises and little extras  I
just didnt expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy
to someone whom Id never met  Therefore I did everything in my power to
rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this
You think Im a psycho  Not to mention I had to face Brendan and before he
could read my Email you had already revealed the stroy to him  SO I got
to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience

Ok thats it  take it however you will but its am and Im exhausted
I did the best I could to figure out and fix a possibly nonexisting
problem  I hope I did well enough to inspire a response from you    Hope
to hear or read from you soon

Goodnight and God Bless

Nikki

Im trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at Kyrene for the st of May didnt make it into the preschedule sheet Im looking for the following deals

  STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH   MW  
	 comments Losses at Kyrene

  STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH   MW  
	 comments Delivery at Kyrene

These deals are pulling into the CARP report but are not shown in either the preschedule or Real Time El Paso models Therefore Enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model Can you give me a hint on this one

Mark 

The ad hoc teams product is attached  It is a suggested revision to the
NERC AA time table for the WSCC  Some basic points are

	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC preschedule flag  The
table provides rules for etag software to automatically set the flag

	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment  The team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ie
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee  tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee  approval
entities would receive compensation for assessingapproving late tags
etc  But a financial mechanism would likely have to go through a
cumbersome reviewapproval process which would be too inflexible for the
fast paced world of ETag and NERCs electronic scheduling  So the
suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved
the closer the submittal time is to the start time  To do this we
considered three parameters  the assessment window deferred denial and
the default composite status

		The assessment window is a period time that the ETag
Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag
Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the
final composite status

		Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag the composite
status does not immediately become Denied but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status  This allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it if
appropriate

		The default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag  Currently tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved  Tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to Denied

	For realtime tagging we cite the hourahead business where
Purchasingselling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour

		Tags submitted in the first half of the hourahead referred
to  to  past will have a  minute assessment window are subjected to
deferred denial and will default to ApprovedConditional

		Tags submitted from  to  past will have a  minute
assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called
instant denial and but will still default to ApprovedConditional

		Tags submitted in the after  past will have a  minute
assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called
instant denial and will default to Denied thus assigned a composite
status of Late

	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistant time zone standard  The
team was divided on the best approach  Some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the LCA  This would require each CA to
include in the etag registry their time zone  Some suggested  all times on
the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time  And some suggested that all times
on the table be in Pacific Standard Time  The conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion

	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agents time clock  it should stay with the authority service

	Heres a big one  because the timing table allows for later
submittal times the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the WSCC standard ramp ie currently starts at  minutes before the
hour  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the
feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to  minute duration stranddling the hour ie starts
at  and ends at   Such a change would aglign the WSCC with the
Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals

IWe are  MW short at the MidColumbia during the offpeak hours for Monday HE  thru HE  HE   We are short to Portland General  When you buy put  MW in the ShortTerm Northwest Book and put the other  in the West Hourly BOM book

KateBill  does this sound reasonable Do you have anything to add


Please make a note of the following I know we have several new traders and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job Thanks

 Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book Pay attention when extending deals If you dont purchase the energy in a particular book you dont have energy to sell from that book

 Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso

 El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done Check spreadsheet formulas 

 El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model melectricepeepeaugepe reconciliation model and all variances explained

 Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a  FLAT broker fee per trade If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades enter a permegawatt fee and extend the deal later with bilateral trades youre effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL Can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldnt simply multiply  times the number of Bloomberg trades done Please let me know

 Most importantly if you are unsure call someone who is

Thanks again for your attention to these matters

Subject	PGE Park Suite Talk  First Right of Refusal


One of the benefits of our suite at PGE Park is that we have the first right of refusal on nonPortland Family Entertainment events such as PSU Football games and the City JazzFest concert  ENA will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public  NonPortland Family Entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for Enron employees and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties  

If you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the PSU Football games or City JazzFest please notify me via email by  pm Pacific Time Friday June   These tickets are to be purchased by the employee The entire suite must be purchased by Enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets  Twentytwo tickets per event are available   are seats and stools  are standing room

	The price for City JazzFest Sunday July  is  for  tickets  about  per ticket  

	The price for all  PSU Vikings games  tickets each is   about  per game per person and all  games must be purchased

We will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment

Please let me know if you have any questions

Best regards

Description of City JazzFest  This full day music fest will feature Jeff Lorber Spyro Gyra Marc Antoine and the headlining package Dave Koz  Friends including Michael McDonald Brian Culbertson and Norman Brown The show is produced by House Of Blues Concerts  An intimate concert setting has been developed at PGE Park that will feel like a small amphitheatre but with all the new amenities PGE Park has to offerGroup

As a general rule we are not submitting supplemental bids for our generators unless there is a Stage  emergency  We wanted to lay out a plan of action in case the ISO dispatches one of the generators during nonbusiness hours ie when the Services Desk is not in the office  And I know what youre thinking Leaf this does not mean between the hours of am and pm 

We have two rules of thumb to follow   if the ISO dispatches Harbor Cogen   if the ISO dispatches any of our other generators

  If the ISO dispatches Harbor please decline the ADS instruction  The reason for the decline is they are offline and are having startup issues  Then immediately call one of the members of the Services Desk  The order to call would be Stan Chris then Les  Either one of us will then discuss with you what should be done next  The most probable scenario would call for you to put in Supplemental Energy Bids in for Harbor equal to their costs

  If the ISO dispatches any of our other generators Arco Delano Sierra Power Wheelabrator please decline the ADS instruction  The reason for the decline is they are offline and are having startup issues  Once again immediately call either myself Chris or Les to discuss what should be done next

	As the deal clearly turned sour and lowest offer in the s I opted to take the short to the imbalance and hedge the price risk
	
	HE  bought mw from Aquilla at a fixed price of  and sold mw vs the expost settlement price
	HE  bought mw from Aquilla at a fixed price of  and sold mw vs the expost settlement price

	I found a decent offer for HE     Reliant so I didnt hedge

	Expost settled just above  for both hours and Jason will be in on Monday to confirm these prices with me

	I spoke with Coral about financial deals as well but Travis didnt seem to understand which side of the deal he was on as he lowered his fixed offer as a counter

There is never time to do it right but there is always time to do it overIMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PGE BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware the claims bar date in the PGE bankruptcy is September
th  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PGE the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December   Order  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule information that is relevant to them
As we have advised in prior Market Notices although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding ie assert claims of ISO
Debtors against ISO Creditors ISO Tariff Section   Further
while the ISO may be asked by an ISO Debtor to assert such claims in the
PX or PGE bankruptcy cases the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participants claims whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PGE bankruptcy proceedings
Further as we have advised in prior Market Notices all statements
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty
are subject to change  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC Federal Courts and State Courts the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PGE to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PGE In addition we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible  Nonetheless it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved andor unidentified by the
claims bar date
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX
and PGE

I wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me Bill entered a purchase annuity from LPac    for a ramp down 

Please let me know if any of this sounds familiar Thresa said this dispute was filed back in June so shes eager to get it resolved

AmyI agree with Jerrys proposal  However I would like to add one more
thing
Change the PSE Submit Deadline for a realtime tag to  minutes instead

of Transaction is greater than or equal to  minutes

Subject FW Possible new Etag time table


Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in ETag

What he is proposing is
	a revision to the timeline tables in AA to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or realtime
currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag
	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Areas prevailing time
this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and its the Authority Service that keeps the time

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the  release

Process
Please review his proposal and comment
Specifically do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS  If there is
support from all of ISAS then it can be taken to NERC ISTISWG for
approval

Please let me know by the end of business June

  tag time table draft june doc
 Bob

 Mark Hackney suggested I start with you on this issue since you were
 heading up the timing group for ISAS

 Here is the issue  under the current WSCC timing table for tags in Policy
  it is impossible to program whether or not the tag is preschedule or
 realtime  The NERC tagging group is the group that came up with manually
 selecting the preschedule flag  I know that PPW BPA and ourselves have
 run into a couple of problems with this  Its been when the merchant has
 selected that flag when it was actually a realtime transaction  PPW and
 ourselves put it in our scheduling system BPA and someone else did not


 At the NERC OSC meeting last week I asked the question again about how
 can this be fixed in version   I was hoping it was as easy as having
 each authority register their timezone in the new Master registry thats
 being developed  Well  it wasnt that easy  They explained the other
 problems and I then developed the attached time table  The group reviewed
 this time table and agreed that it could be automated to determine if a
 tag was preschedule or realtime

 In order to get this programmed into version  we need to get Policy 
 revised with the new time table  In order to get the new time table
 approved it probably starts with your subgroup then probably goes to
 Hackney for an email vote to ISAS then probably on to WSCC OC then
 finally to NERC  Problem is we need to do this quickly by the end of
 June if possible so that the new Policy  will be out in time for 
 release in October

 Now  theres nothing that says this has to happen either  Another option
 is to just leave it as it is today  Id prefer to automate it but thats
 only my opinion

 At any rate  the NERC OSC has agreed to include timezone in the new NERC
 Master registry  They have also agreed to incorporate this change into
  if its part of Policy   Thats were we stand right now

 As for your subgroup  I dont think Im on your list but go ahead and
 add me on if you dont mind

 Call or email if you have any questions

third different individual at EPMI who has had an interaction with him resu

has happened with  other people here and only with Hildago I now believe
 the problem is him  He has a natural antagonistic demeanor that makes peo
ple defensive and angry  When he calls he accuses us of not meeting our ob

ide this information I will turn you in   We understand our responsibilit
y to provide outage information to the ISO  We are diligent in completing 
outage reports and submitting them to the outage coordination desk at the I
SO  The ISO is requiring an additional communication with the Real Time gr
oup to either  confirm that the outage ended as planned or  change th
e outage timing if required  Although to my knowledge this requirement i
s not in the ISO tariff and has not been communicated to SCs in writing in
 any way and furthermore is a waste of time for everyone will make effort
s to do this  The ISO should recognize however that in most cases our R
eal Time Group is not aware of outages our generator SC clients nor should
 they be as these units our off line and therefore out of play in Real T
ime  Hildago should work to communicate better and treat people with respe
ct  He clearly is not doing that with us

Is this the right idea

FYI 

Roger called today to inform us of a bottleneck at Palo Verde Apparently El Paso cannot take more than  mw into their system at Palo in any given hour therefore we need to monitor El Pasos net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement If El Paso is taking a net of  mw in at PV youll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee to fill the lending short then enter a zero priced buyresale to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV 

This is how it should take place  
DayAhead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
HourAhead	
	Buy from Counterparty X at FC or Greenlee 
	BuyResale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV

To all 

As you may already know the Short Term West Hourly desk began trading the Enron Online hourly market on Monday These deals should be treated just like all Short Term West Hourly deals  they do not need to be confirmed Unfortunately it seems the EOL application created for us is defaulting to YesConfirm and West Hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters 

Ive spoken with the EOL help desk about changing this default setting and theyve informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change In the meantime I wanted to make you aware of these deals existence You will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the Short Term West Hourly desk in the future and many of these will be made on EOL Again these should be treated as with any other West Hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed

Please let me know if you have any questions about this Ill let you know as soon as Ive heard more conclusive information from EOL And thanks for your help

Group questions power payments
POWER CRISIS 
By Mike Taugher
CONTRA COSTA TIMES 





An industry trade group asked market officials on Wednesday why they have failed to pay more than  billion for power sold during April and May

For some reason the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators said Jan SmutnyJones director of the Independent Energy Producers Association Our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding

Part of the answer officials said is that the states powerbuying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash

Compounding the problem is the fact that when the May bills began coming due earlier this month some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full according to the Independent System Operator

That left the ISO less able to pay its May bills said ISO President and CEO Terry Winter in a written statement

The ISO acknowledges that past debt is due Winter said in the statement

Winter said the ISO would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by Friday But in response to the IEP letter he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills

The ISO runs the spot markets in California Buyers and sellers make their bids through the ISO which sets the market price based on those bids collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers 

The issue came to a head Wednesday when the IEP sent a letter to the ISO demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in April and May SmutnyJones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around  billion

In early April federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the ISO market That forced the state Department of Water Resources which began buying electricity in January to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities customers

DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them 

We havent been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what were going to be paid for Hidalgo said We are working with the ISO to see how we can get some of that information that were not getting

ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said his agency is working with the water department but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential

We cant tell one market participant what another market participant is doing Fishman said

Manager of State Policy Affairs

 Please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on Bloomberg

	 Bloomberg charges a  FLAT broker fee
	 This fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade
	 This fee applies each time you make a trade on Bloomberg
		ie  per hit or lift regardless of volume
	 When you extend a Bloomberg deal in Deal Entry account for each separate trade accordingly 	by adding  to any existing broker fee
  	 Because this fee is FLAT select the FLAT button to the right of the broker fee 
	 And most importantly make a note in the BROKER box that the broker is in fact Bloomberg

I know that many of you were never notified of the Bloomberg fee structure but going forward we should see every trade done on Bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with Bloomberg The Confirms group in Houston has compiled a weighty list of missing hourly trades since the advent of Real Time Bloomberg trading I believe these are all in the system but possibly short a broker name and fee This going forward should no longer be a problem

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding Bloomberg trading andor fees 

Thanks

 Our meeting yesterday involved Bill Kate Mike Purcell and myself
The purpose of the meeting was to develop a protocol for El Paso disputes and intramonth trueup and to get an idea of how Kates position ties in to settlements  
 
From my understanding our EL Paso protocol will be as such
 
The Model will be reconciled on a daily basis by Kate and she will attempt trueup for the whole Model including prescheduled deals
Kate will not be responsible for Prescheduled deals that are incorrect
Kate will be the point of contact for El Paso and Houston Settlements when they have pressing matters otherwise Houston will contact Virginia Bill would like to be Ccd on all matters
When contacted regarding an El Paso discrepancy there will be a day limit for response from the real time group
Bill would like to be notified of any major changes that are made to the El Paso Model or to EnPower
Houston may contact Bill at any time if they deem it necessary  Bill would like to receive feedback and to be addressed with any compliants
 
 
From my understanding Kates role will be as such
 
To dedicate approximately  of her time to the VMSettlements group to help with trueups and dispute resolution
To maintain customer service contact with Roger and Kathy at El Paso and maintain daily Model to Enpower trueup
To help maintain Montana Power service deals and make corrections according to research 
To be a filter for disputes from VMsettlements group and to follow up on those disputes until they are settled
Tagging  template cleanup
Control Area Checkouts
FSP testing
Book Reconciliation
 
 
I will update you if things change

Here is a confirm that is designed to go under our EEI agreement with El Paso  If signed it would entirely replace our old services consulting agreement with El Paso 

 Please read the document from a business perspective  Do not worry too much about the legal boilerplate of which there is plenty  At the end of the day the document should contain what you guys think you are doing with El Paso from a common sense perspective  Pushing all the very important legal boilerplate aside  do you see our deal in these words Please let me know your comments Thanks very much cgyA pregunta is a question in Spanish I am going to Seattle with my friends from FL on the thth The Palace of Fine Arts is just this really cool place in San Fran that has huge statues greek in nature around this gorgeous pond with awesome flowers and trees etc Its so wierd just to be sitting in the city the way it is I saw this place that looked similar but in Seattle in some movie recently but they never said the name of the place I just figured you might know but thanks for the ideas

     Sorry we missed the  large that your desk had coming for congestion revenue on Saterday   To fix the situation I have made a manual entry for that date but since the flash has already been set and saved you will not see that change until the month end reports  You will just have to trust that the correction was made and look for it at month end  I will check also when we run the month end to ensure you see the revenue   We wont miss anymore congestion revenue   Let me know if you have any questions

Please see me with questions

BillGood Afternoon

I am looking at version  the day I was checking was initally June  but switched over to June th new data

TEXT WRAPPING

The text wraps in the following Fields
	Counterparty
	Tag
	Comments

The text does not consistently wrap in the Path field which is the most critical field to have wrap

MISSING TRANSMISSION INFORMATIONJune th reran to check this
	The transmission information from Trans TransOasis seems to be coming thru inconsistently and I still do not see the transmission information from  Trans 	Trans Oasis represented  I reran my data from the th to check it BUT when I went to delete my data for the th and there was none there  Do you all know if 	this data was purposefully removed or did it just go away The only data that seems to have survived to this version is the data from 

SORTING

	By Tag  I see how to make it sort in the strip but cannot just look at tag numbers Right now in Lotus If i activate the sort by tag I get a list and If I just start 	typing a tag number it takes me to the one I want  Can we have that Capability duplicated  

	By Global ID  This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area

EXPANDED VIEW
	Will the Path size in the expanded view be fixed in the next release  I still cannot see the whole path
	The Delivery point is blank when I pull this up but I populated border  and  What drives this

PATH CUT working in June th data
	I was able to sucessfully cut a path  but with the following problems
	 Region still needs to be the forced choice that I mentioned in earlier emails
	 After a path is cut and I go into the original path I cant see any way to easily find the cut associated with the path Maybe a Go to Cut button
	I would like to be able to add incremental hours to a cut as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time A new tag might have to be made each 	hour of the cut



Question In the expanded view of the Path under counterparty  I see a name of a person kind of greyed out  Who is this person It does not match the trader name on the deal  I looked at Williams deal    Janelle Barsness shows in the path expanded view but no trader is visible in the trade Done on EOL  I looked at WAPA deal   Kathy Crane is in the path expanded view and Penny Casey is their trader  

Thats all for now  catch you all on Monday

PGE has informed us that they have a couple of voice mail cards that are down

WHAT THIS MEANS

If a call that is going to voice mail hits one of these cards the call will continue to ring without ever getting to voice mail 

This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability

If this happens the party would have to call back and try again or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message


THE FIX

PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday  They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail

The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday  PST and should last no more than  hours


Please let me know if you have any questions

Regards

Dave

After researching these three deals weve found that our group does not have access to reliable thirdparty documentation to support their occurrence Because there are no Real Time confirmation letters and no NERC Tags were done for hourly deals at the beginning of this year it falls to cash invoices to support the validity of Real Time deals Ive spoken with Stacey White in Houstons Risk group and she explained to me that there are documents our Settlements group can access that may provide the information you need

Im sorry to keep sending you from group to group but Ill be more than happy to help you get ahold of people who can provide you with relevant deal documentation

Please let me know if you have any questions

PaulA final word on the new DMS procedure Mike feels its important you know that Volume Management will thoroughly research each discrepancy before bringing it to your attention

Make sure they understand that we will exhaust all of our efforts before we send it over to them  
All notes will be provided on the DMS telling them where we are and what we found out and where they should look says Purcell

So when the discrepancy shows up in your file which you will check at the beginning of each shift it is there because our back office professionals have hit an impasse and require your assistance to get through it That means its important

Thanks

In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC June  order the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ISO was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all instate load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs  In compliance the ISO filed on July   proposed Tariff
revisions to develop
	a rate for the emission allowance charge 
	an escrow account for monies collected 
	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees and 
	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs  
In a Market Notice posted on August   the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at httpwwwcaisocomdocshtml
httpwwwcaisocomdocshtml 
The June  FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude startup fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price and instead to
pay generators for such startup fuel costs in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees  In a Market Notice posted on
August   the ISO published the initial startup fuel charge rate
The ISO has modified the previously posted startup fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this
rate  This information is also posted at
httpwwwcaisocomdocshtml

CR CommunicationsI confirmed w Keoni in relation to payments for Rplc Reserves  The ISO will only pay the Capacity or Energy PaymentNOT both

							There are a few changes to Saturdays schedule so please disregard my previous email


Group

The plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for Saturday   The plan is as follows

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage  emergency is called  This is due to the ISOs ability to ramp the units up and down every  minutes  We dont want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage   or  emergency

So please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade  Below is their preschedule mws available minimum price threshold and unit IDs  Also attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone s  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators

Subject	As the CAISO Turns  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts

Everyone

This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought  I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention

  According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff  The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions

  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first  CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section  d  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy  If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as   Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR  

  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as   Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it

  While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis  Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts  Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO

  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of  expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to   These SCs are in for a big surprise  According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy  Where is the price mitigation here

  Who benefits under this scam  Davis and CDWR  Who loses under this scam  Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy

  Sources  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also

  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito

There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say  but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait  days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets

Can you send me a copy of the Burrito that we were discussing or at
least outline in an email the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published   What is the official name of this
newsletter  I have seen them in the past Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me but I havent seen it for a long time

Also to recap our telephone discussion  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type  are determined by CERS and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases and  pricingcharges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over or underschedule  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly

Thanks a lot for your assistance

Steve
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling   Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged   is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh  is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO  His response was this  that the CAISO is charging  regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS  In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS   

KitGood MorningAfternoonEvening

I started working in June  to test path cut capabilities  I was able to save a cut path  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time

A Real Time Question
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance as it sometimes is at night will this application still function  If not we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained


ReRunning June th as a completely new day This entire test was done in local Enpower

Path Confirmation

Speed is very much an issue here  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths The confirmation of  paths as a group took  seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ok button until the confriming was completed This is too long we need this to be  seconds max Currently this process takes about  seconds in lotus Confriming  paths with the th fully populated took 

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report This also took over a minute  This is another  second process in lotus

One little housekeeping thing  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button  This will save us mucho headaches later OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion

All of the sorting looks great the paths are represented properly we are very very close


Real Time Discussion

Where are we on this  I heard initial rumblings but nothing lately

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 

    

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about  but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours

BMark 

The ad hoc teams product is attached  It is a suggested revision to the
NERC AA time table for the WSCC  Some basic points are

	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC preschedule flag  The
table provides rules for the etag software to automatically set the flag

	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment  The team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ie
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee  tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee  approval
entities would receive compensation for assessingapproving late tags
etc  But a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome
reviewapproval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced
world of ETag and NERCs electronic scheduling  So the suggested
incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer
the submittal time is to the start time  To do this we considered three
parameters  the assessment window deferred denial and the default
composite status

		The assessment window is a period time that the ETag
Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag
Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the
final composite status

		Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag the composite
status does not immediately become Denied but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status  This allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it if
appropriate

		The default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag  Currently tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved  Tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to Denied

	For realtime tagging we cite the hourahead business where
Purchasingselling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour

		Tags submitted in the first half of the hourahead referred
to  to  past will have a  minute assessment window are subjected to
deferred denial and will default to ApprovedConditional

		Tags submitted from  to  past will have a  minute
assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called
instant denial and but will still default to ApprovedConditional

		Tags submitted in the after  past will have a  minute
assessment window are not subjected to deferred denial can be called
instant denial and will default to Denied thus assigned a composite
status of Late

	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard  The
team was divided on the best approach  Some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the LCA  This would require each CA to
include in the etag registry their time zone  Some suggested  all times on
the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time  And some suggested that all times
on the table be in Pacific Standard Time  The conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion

	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agents time clock  submittal time should stay with the authority service

	Heres a big one  because the timing table allows for later
submittal times the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the WSCC standard ramp ie currently starts at  minutes before the
hour  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the
feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to  minute duration straddling the hour ie starts
at  and ends at   Such a change would align the WSCC with the
Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals

	There was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice
for the tariff deadline for schedule changes most are set to  before the
start  It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to
change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner

	The team did not want to address at this time issues concerning
multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy  or the
ETag specifications

	Finally the team can not stress enough that a composite status of
Late should not and does not mean automatic denial  The Late designation
simple indicates that the default composite status is Denied  Approval
entities should make every effort to assess all tags Late or not

Hurray for the team members many many thanks

FYI 

Roger called today to inform us of a bottleneck at Palo Verde Apparently El Paso cannot take more than  mw into their system at Palo in any given hour therefore we need to monitor El Pasos net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement If El Paso is taking a net of  mw in at PV youll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee to fill the lending short then enter a zero priced buyresale to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV 

This is how it should take place

KateFederal Caps Didnt Deter Higher Prices
Power CalISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July  

SACRAMENTO  After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap according to a confidential study by state grid operators

The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June  CalISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation The report is a summary of what CalISO calls possible anticompetitive behavior by Duke Energy Williams Cos Mirant Corp Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp

In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost said Greg Cook senior policy analyst with CalISOs Department of Market Analysis The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded Instead the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market

The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California

CalISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants

The average cost for the five was  per megawatthour which closely matches the federal price limit in California which now stands at  per megawatthour According to the power bidding procedures companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price allowing them to make a substantial profit

On average four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production But with the exception of Atlantabased Mirant each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher Houstonbased Reliant for example bid as much as  per megawatthour more than five times its estimated cost Overall Reliants average bid was close to costs according to the analysis

CalISO identified companies by code in its report Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times

The CalISO report singled out Supplier  identified by sources as Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs

Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast It marked up its bids an average of  beyond its cost to produce electricity according to the analysis For example it cost Duke  to  to generate a megawatthour of electricity in the time period studied the report shows but the company offered to sell a megawatthour from  to 

Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said The use of the data in some cases doesnt appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under longterm contracts and not on the spot market which the CalISO report studied he noted

Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Were looking at the data and we question whether or not it is correct

A combination of cool weather heavy conservation the startup of new power plants and recently signed longterm power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the states electricity crisis in recent weeks

Market prices that as recently as May averaged  per megawatthour have dropped to less than  per megawatthour

The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higherpriced bids But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten Wolak said

Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June  he said

The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to CalISO a Folsombased agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving  of California CalISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the states electrical freeway and avert blackouts

As Californias fledgling market began to go haywire last fall CalISO workers struggled to purchase as much as  of the states power demand with just hours to spare Since then the market has stabilized and CalISOs purchases now amount to roughly  of the electricity California consumes

A reminder

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues Ive requested several sets of tapes over the past few days As you know these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings However none of the taped conversations Ive listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for many didnt name a delivery point and some left out a price 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours reconfirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment theyre created or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that

As always let me know if you have questions about this

Dear Melissa or Thresa

  I have completed DMSs   and  for Sierra Pacific  The total of the two will be a negative   impact on the real time books  
  I was wondering if we could pull this change thru today so that it comes thru in the next PMA report
  I know Amy will be back July  so I was wondering if someone could do it for her The real time book will be taking another  hit soon so I wanted to split these  big    hits between  PMA reports if at all possible

  Please let me know

  Thanks

   NEW YORK Dow JonesLess than a month after the Federal Energy
 Regulatory
 Commission shot the messenger its looking for new volunteers
   On June  the FERC totally trashed US wholesale electricity markets
 with
 price controls and an order for refunds dating back to October or to May
  or
 to whenever they later decide What is the FERC price cap on electricity
 throughout the western US Well its whatever the California
 Independent
 System Operator decides it is
   Nevertheless on Wednesday the FERC made a sharp Uturn in the direction
 of
 free markets for power With unquestioning confidence it ordered all US
 utilities to consolidate their transmission lines into a few independent
 transmission operators in order to foster free trade and movement of
 electricity
   Surely some might say the FERC didnt give the California ISO total
 price
 discretion over the western US did it After all the ISO is simply the
 administrator of the FERCs very precise formulas like this one for
 nonemergencies the cost of burning natural gas assuming a power plant
 is
 located both in northern California and southern California at the least
 efficient generator that was called on in the most expensive hour of the
 most
 recent Stage  emergency that wasnt a Stage  at any point during the
 hour
 plus  for operation and maintenance multiplied by  then add  if
 the
 buyer is the California Department of Water Resources
   What could be more clear More marketbased as the FERC trumpeted its
 own
 ingenuity How could the ISO possibly manipulate that
   The ISOs initial cap of  a megawatthour was based on a gas price of
 
 After inputting the other elements that cap turns out to be based on a
 quite
 efficient heat rate of  Surely the heat rate of the least efficient
 unit
 used in the most recent emergency etc was  or higher
   But the ISO decided it didnt want to pay more than MWh Who
 confirms
 that the ISO really used the correct heat rate Nobody
   Now after gas prices crashed to  the ISO had full discretion  based
 on a
 technicality  to avoid resetting the cap At all four opportunities the
 ISO
 declined to reset the cap because the ISO staff know they cant get the
 power
 California needs for  which is where the cap would have come out using
 the
 old  heat rate Thats way below the costs of the marginal generators
 needed
 when things get even a little tight
   Sierra Pacific Resources SRP Nevada Power couldnt get all the power
 it
 needed July  for  even
   So what is the FERC price cap on western power Whatever the California
 ISO says it
 is
   Not surprisingly Nevada Power and others western utilities are furious
 with
 California for successfully using its political muscle to export its
 problem to
 the rest of the West
   Before the FERC price caps the market definitely was working When you
 had
 prices of  a megawatthour people were mortgaging their restaurants
 to buy
 a diesel generator to sell power into the grid said Chelan County Public
 Utility Districts Chuck Berrie one of a handful of utility veterans in
 the
 US who thrived in the deregulated wholesale market Unlike those of most
 other
 western utilities Chelans customers havent seen a rate increase and
 wont for
 the next five years because Berrie and his coworkers have maximized the
 utilitys assets and market opportunities
   People were coming out of the woodwork to get generators on line Ive
 never
 seen anything like it But the FERC order killed them Berrie said
   Orders for hundreds of small dieselfired generators that could have
 helped
 get the West through the next  months or so were canceled immediately
 after
 the FERC order because the generators cost more than MWh to operate
 They
 are expensive to run but could have patched over the shortage until big
 permanent power plants are finished in  But who wanted to bet in late
 June
 that the California ISO would pass up the opportunity for a  price cap
 So
 the orders were canceled
   In fact even with the cap stuck at  at least  megawatts of
 installed
 generators are being taken off line and sent back to the rental companies
 When
 the blackouts come hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses will be
 without power that the generators could have provided
   The biggest manufacturer of such generators Caterpillar Inc CAT
 said it
 is redirecting the units to Brazil which like the western US is highly
 dependent on hydroelectricity And Brazil like the West is enduring a
 drought
 this year Brazil however isnt under FERC jurisdiction
   But surely the generators must not be needed if we are sending them down
 to
 poor old Brazil
   Not so according to utility employees like Berrie as well as the
 quasigovernmental Northwest Power Planning Council The chances of
 blackouts
 this summer and winter is still much higher than acceptable and of
 course
 higher still without those temporary generators
   Price controls kill the messenger High prices say that supply should be
 increased and usage reduced Really high prices like those the West has
 endured
 for the past year say Hurry
   But the administration of George W Bush after getting a good ol
 political
 whuppin at the hands of California Gov Gray Davis agreed to shoot the
 messenger
   Why would anybody get into this industry with all the uncertainty of
 this
 ridiculousness Its the price caps as well as the rebates Or youre
 going to
 get sued Regular people were practically turning over their couches to
 get the
 nickels together to invest in a generator and they have lost their
 investment
 Berrie says
   I think the horse is dead Even if you removed the regulations and
 prices did
 come back up people still wont come back What certainty would you have
 that
 they wont change the rules again Who can take that risk he added
   Yet the FERC just ordered the restructuring of many billions of dollars
 of
 transmission lines as the foundation of a free market
   In the East they must be wondering what that messenger said before the
 FERC
 shot him Apparently it was Brazils economy can afford to pay more for
 electricity than the US economy can

KateISO Market Participants
As announced in a market notice last Thursday July  the ISO is
considering new processes for implementing the mustoffer obligation that
would permit compliance with the FERCs Order and also take into
consideration the particular concerns of generating units with long startup
times and operating costs that may not be fully recoverable during periods
of relatively low Energy prices
The ISO has posted on its web site a Draft Proposal that is intended to
provide Market Participants with an opportunity to comment upon and discuss
some modifications the ISO is considering to the procedures described in

Hi Godfrey

I would like to summarize our discussion on those deals we have had questions about as described in the previous emails in terms of when and how they will be come through or corrected in the coming future Please review and let me know if they are not correct

   the change in the annuity amount of  from  to  will be coming through in June desk analysis  PMA at the end of July as an outflow to STWServ book 
Chris and Les  I will put in a new annuity deal for the amount of  for StWServ book sell to StWhourly to reflect the change in desk from StWhourly to StWServ of the deal the desk change made on  was not picked up by settlement as they were not informed With the adjustment the net effect of  will be given back to WServ

   it will come through in June desk analysis

     since these are interdesk deals we will take care of it by entering two new annuity deals today    They were not picked up by settlement as PMA when they were entered on    because they were interdesk deals

 leg   they will show up in July desk analysis  PMA at the end of August

   the change in the annuity amount of  from  to  will be coming through in Jun desk analysis as an outflow to STWServ book
Again the change in desk from StWhouly to StWServ will then be reflected by a new annutiy deal for  with STWServ sell to STWhouly

     they will show up in June desk analysis  PMA at the end of July

Please feel free to correct or add anything to the above information

Hey Guys

I went through all the templates and removed the RT prefix for all the templates You can now sort them alphabetically making the process of finding the right template a lot easier From now on please do no use the RT prefix when creating new templates

GeirI am working in the target date of June th  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group Once COB is added we will have pretty much an average daily volume

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    


In Preschedule Workspace

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of  lines into the Path confirmation The rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so I marked them for routing only  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and I have to make notes on what is wrong Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwards

Routing functionality question  If we change a delivery point in scheduling BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point  These types of deals route now I would like to duplicate that existing functionality I did get an error message on those lines Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points Please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line  thru  but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered

The routing speed is EXCELLENT One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower The megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging My Palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower short name to something that is workable  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable 

Yesterday I identified several problems

 The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp

 The Alias list is not functioning properly  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp

 Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by line


Today I am finding the following

  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point  These fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur

I am not allowed to sort by Global ID  even though global IDs are populated there My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys

 Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over  minutes  This is to long to be practical in production for real time I would like to see this time go to  seconds or less

  All paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet

 The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable Variations of the beige color are easier to read

 The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first and then populate the cut This is a bit different than we discussed  My plan is to take this as far as I can and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final tweaking

 I also cannot sort by tag number  We need that



Thank you all for your work on this it is really looking good 
I have to schedule on Monday but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks

Good Afternoon Fred

After our call a better solution presented itself to me  The best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by EPE would come from EPE directly to Enrons real time group  

Please see the following prototype sheet that I have made I have checked with Bill and Greg and they both agree that this format will give Real time the hourly shapes that they need with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr  This sheet could be created and sent after the Etag deadline has passed giving EPEs group ample time to get all the information that they need before Real time would ever need it

Since Etag is a fact of life for all of us now we would benefit the most by building Etag into our solution  By comparing the Etags that EPE recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties EPE has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves  Enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers

Having EPE generate this abbreviated sheet for EPMI real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have

Please take a look at this sheet and see how you like it  Real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be On Call for that day  

I welcome any questions or comments

Dear Bill Kate and Les

   I wanted to let you all know what we are doing concerning deals   purchase from Willamet  and  sale to PACE  
I believe that we are all now familiar with the details of these deals   Mike Geir Les and I have spent a combined  hours or more researching this deal over the last month  Our last resort is to pull the tapes  As we do not have access to our tapes and I am not sure when we will have them back we have decided to do the following until we have the tapes back and can verify that the sale to PAC did take place  

 I have extended the sale of  MWs of Willamet generation to PAC to include HE   
 I have TEMPORARILY zerod out the HE  piece of this deal on the PAC side with notes

As the payment is  months overdue we will pay now and get reimbursed if we find that we are correct

Please share any thoughts with me that you may have

Thanks to everyone for your help in researching this

VirginiaBill  

  Kate and I are still working on MPCs March checkouts  That was the messy month that we had discrepancies almost every day and I sent out a big email to the whole group and listed problems with the names of who was on shift that day

If this deal was zeroed out and it has been after the fact then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC the other side of the deal

Virgina and Bill

During our monthend processes I have researched deal   The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE   Originally the deal liquidated with HE MWh HEMWh  and HE MWh but on  the volume for HE was zeroed out in scheduling which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE back

Thanks

I have one question on this months PMA and some questions from last month  First for deal  this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  Are we being charged for each counterparty again like EES and STCali last month if so we need to fix this flawed tool 

Second for last month we determined that the WBOM book needs a  PMA for change in price  The appropriate price is in Enpower but the revenue has never appeared Deal  Remember this deal was originally input as a buy at  and a sell at  and liquidated at these prices The deal is now at  and   What do we need to do to get this trued up
Please come see me with questions

Thank you for your help

  Mtg Datesxls After the Day ahead market ran the Path  branch group TTC in the NS
direction was changed from  MW to  MW and the Path  branch group
TTC in both directions was changed from  MW to  MW for HEs  and
 for operating day   The reasons for the change is due to the
lines being deenergized for CB test  The first applicable Hour Ahead

changes in line rating status  Sent by Market Operations inquiries please
call the Hour Ahead Desk

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current
accurate information available in preparing this notice system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice  The appearance of FERC commissioners before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee the Wednesday after next is probably driving the timing of the FERCs meeting next Monday at which they will consider CA matters  It is possible that FERC is trying to fashion a silver bullet to use at the Senate hearing  The article below also discusses Feinsteins allegations of undue influence at FERC  Ray


Lieberman summons FERC members for hearing
Gas Daily June  

Taking a lead from Democratic California Sen Dianne Feinstein Sen Joseph Lieberman
DConn said Wednesday that he would haul FERC commissioners before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee to find out if the agency has exercised proper oversight of
electric rates The hearings promise to put further heat on FERC which has thus far resisted
calls to impose price caps on the California power market

Lieberman said he would hold a hearing on June  to find out whether the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission has been properly executing its duties to provide fair and
reasonable electric rates The call for hearings was Liebermans first move upon becoming
head of the committee

In the immediate future I hope to focus the committees oversight and investigate duties
on an examination of high energy prices and what can be done to lower them Lieberman said
That agenda should cheer Californias Senate delegation and California Gov Gray Davis
who have accused FERC of dereliction of duty when it comes to monitoring the states energy
markets Liebermans announcement in fact comes in direct response to a plea from Feinstein to
launch an investigation into FERCs relationship with the industry it is charged with monitoring

In a letter to Lieberman following the recent Senate power shift Feinstein hinted at the
undue influence that the energy industry exercises over the commission FERC said Feinstein
has failed to fulfill its legally mandated function under the Federal Power Act to restore just
and reasonable electricity rates GD 

Feinsteins concerns were prompted in part by a New York Times report that Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay had attempted to lobby FERC for increased retail competition and access to transmission
lines According to the newspaper Lay offered FERC Chairman Curt Hebert a titfortat
deal in which Hebert would help expedite retail competition in exchange for political support
Hebert reportedly refused the deal  and Lay disputed Heberts account of the conversation

A PBS news special coproduced by the Times may further help bolster public perceptions
that the industry is unreasonably close to FERC however According to the program which
aired Tuesday FERC did not move ahead with an investigation of alleged manipulation of the
California natural gas market until after the Times made certain confidential documents public

FERC sent the case to an administrative law judge on March   one day after a story
ran in the Times on the controversy surrounding El Paso Natural Gas leasing of capacity to
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy GD  Prior to that coverage of the story had been
limited largely to the trade press

Establishing that FERC has indeed failed to follow federal guidelines for just and reasonable
rates may prove difficult however At a recent meeting of the Energy Bar Association in
Washington DC Douglas Smith former general counsel with FERC noted the difficulty in
finding criteria for establishing just and reasonable rates no statute he said spells out the
terms precisely GD  NH

		Energy Exchange Program Neutrality Adjustment
		Charge Type 
		SC Settlement Contacts

		Background
		As you may know the Energy Exchange Program began on trade
date   In this program the ISO obtained needed energy in for the
real time market and rather that paying for the energy as a purchase later
returned the energy in another period  This was not necessarily a
oneforone exchange  The incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued  Since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the ISO The ISO created Charge Type  was
developed for the allocation of the cost to SCs participating in the market
during the incoming schedules

		Notification
		The ISO has created Charge Type  so that whenever an
Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the SCs based on their total
negative Uninstructed Energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place  This new Charge Type will appear beginning on the
June   statements which will be published on August    In
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as December 
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data

		CT  is a semi automated charge meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated but it will be a manual charge type
within the Manual Line Item Records and will not require a change to your
settlement system  Note that this charge will not appear on every
statement but only when an Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance

I have reviewed documents from the ISOs website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June  FERC order and concluded the following 

 During a System Emergency a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage and 

 During a NonSystem Emergency a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour 

If you have any questions at all I can be reached at extension   

Thanks

I checked with LVC on tube materials and condenser operating conditions for Unit  Unit  has had no indication of corrosion but the water used for cooling tower makeup is well water and is low in chlorides 
 
Units    will be using city water and the chlorides will be in the  mgl range The following is courtesy of Mike Wisdom and various SS manuals L SS has a moly percentage in the    range In the past before computer control of alloying the Mo percentage was typically in the  range The testing that was done on corrosion resistance was done on  Mo SS L SS has a Mo percentage in the    range LXN SS has a Mo percentage in the    range The L alloys are recommended for use in high chloride concentration streams at elevated temperatures L SS would be the material of choice if the cost difference is not prohibitive 
 
I hope this helps

The drainage ditch issue is still precipated by the eventuality that a sound wall will be constructed    If the sound wall is constructed there will have to be a minimum distance that must be maintained above the  foot  The added cost for higher  larger towers have to be considred  The drainage ditch will not be constructed for four years in the future so the  transmission lines cannot extend into the easement area 

However if we put the culverts in now before transmission lines are constructed then the city MAY allow the penetration into the easement 

For sure if we hang transmission lines into the facility site we will get an interference claim from the Contractor

I will investigate farther the recommended change in condenser materials  As it now stands we are only asking for the additional costs  I have checked the Scope of  Work and it is silent on the tube spec  By copy the wisdom and chemielwski please provide the technical justification for the change in materials  In the days when I was a member of nace  SS was not recommendeed in any service that had chlorides in excess of  ppm due to stress cracks caused by the chlorides Geiv  I have forwarded this to BillWilliamsIIIenroncom  Hes on the real time desk  Im in Power technical services

Hi Bill

I work with Neil Bresnan in Houston and Im responsible for entering the realtime deals into the database I was hoping that whoever creates the realtime sheet that you send to us could just put in the delivery point instead of including both points in a spread deal I think it would be easier for anyone entering the deals here to just have the delivery point Hope I have made my request clear please let me know if I need to clarify this further 

Thanks a lot

Good Afternoon

I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed the  day parallel test milestone for FSP  We were also seeing solid performance for our key metrics during the parallel template writing    finals processing  minutes  Lastly based on my understanding of our golive bet my total debt owed to Tim Belden    Tim I gave the money to Debra

What Next

User Training
I will be working with the DA  Real time guys to make sure everyone is uptospeed with the new system  We are also in the process of developing some user documentation cheat sheets to help in the transition

Production Parallel
We have already begun using FSP in parallel in production by writing templates in FSP  comparing them to CAPS  We will continue doing this until we are getting consistent results between the two systems  This production parallel has necessitated some changes to the existing EnpowertoCAPS report that we have already started modifying

How long 

Once bit twice shy  No money on this one but I dont think it should take over a week to train the users  The production parallel may take a little longer  I am really relying on the users to wrap this one up  Kysa Alport has already volunteered for this duty and I spent a good part of today training her  

Thanks  David Poston  To all 

Ive trued up the El Paso model and Enpower for June Most of these variances were simple adjustments to the model and we should be variancefree for June at this point Also Ive notified the Real Time traders that we will reinstate the El Paso reconciliation model as of July  

Please call me with questions

Number  August 
Negotiation In Emotional Circumstances

Our websites advice section gets questions on a wide
variety of topics from all over the world  Recently a
web visitor posed a question that many of us face 
Often as our own children are establishing themselves
as adults were faced with issues relating to care for
older relatives

Heres our readers question and our response

Convincing Elders To Accept Care

Question As a hospitalgeriatric social worker both
in my personal and work life I am frequently asked the
following question  My elderly parent aunt
neighbor clearly needs some help at home but
refuses this help even if free or done by a family
member a church  How can I convince this person
to accept help

After Ive determined that the issue isnt financial
usually a solvable problem then I am frequently at a
loss  The situations Ive seen like this seem to only
resolve after a crisis occurs and the person has no
choice 

How would you approach a situation like this  The
issues seem to revolve around pride retaining control
denial of illness aging or disability  Any
thoughts

Response In his Notes From The Underground
Dostoevsky wrote Human behavior is motivated by the
craving for absolute freedom and selfassertion in
defiance of all dictates of reason  As decrepitude
takes its toll on our bodies  and minds  often
pride is the only thing we have left

Waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who
think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to
organizing care for people who have less and less
capacity to take care of themselves or their personal
surroundings

Probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of
questions  Using the example of children of an elderly
parent first the concerned children need to ask
themselves what are their own interests  Do they want
to assuage guilt  Do they fear that harm will come to
their parent  Are they concerned that a crisis will
interrupt the normal course of their own lives

Questions also need to be asked of the parent What
most concerns you about your situation  health
comfortable surroundings companionship your capacity
to hold your head up and say Daughter please I can
do it myself  One can also ask What do you think
are the standards that determine ones capacity to live
an independent life

This questioning approach brings the parties into
fuller participation in the decisionmaking process 
When I ask you a question it means I am taking you
seriously the reverse is equally true  In
negotiation this technique is called Active Listening

The crucial element is listening closely to all the
elements of the responses to those questions both the
questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of
other people  It is no less important to respond to
what people say by checking to make sure youve
understood their points you may want to say This is
what I understood you to have said is my understanding
correct  You also want to indicate The fact that I
understand what you have said does not necessarily mean
I agree with you

Clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is
a critical vital sign  The fear of loving relatives
that something bad can happen has to be balanced
against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their
selfesteem you are attacking a most vulnerable part
of their anatomy  You cannot negotiate away a persons
selfesteem but you can destroy it through frontal and
flanking attacks

The frustration faced by folks who see loved ones
failing to take proper care of themselves is
phenomenal  Very often the people who have advocated
professional care ultimately must mutter hopefully to
themselves the unsatisfying statement I told you
so

In your question you indicate that crisis forces
choice  Perhaps the best approach is to prepare a
safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs  It
cannot prevent a crisis from happening and it is
crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by
forcing the victim of it to lose face But having
that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of
the fall

Relationship is one of the seven most significant
issues to consider in negotiation  Focusing on the
relationship with an elderly parent or friend not
letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring
can make it much easier when someones selfesteem is
attacked by a crisis  Looking at oneself and saying
Its not my fault is not a way of avoiding blame
but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their
own mistakes  just as they did the first time they
gave us the keys to the car

Butte Montana  

	Re	Arrangements to Accommodate FERCs June   Order

Dear 

	The Montana Power Company MPC and Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI are parties to a Confirmation Letter dated December   the term of which has been extended by letter dated  under which EPMI has been purchasing energy for resale to MPC or selling energy received from MPC into the wholesale market  As you are no doubt aware the FERC issued an Order on June   that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the WSCC  

One restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers such as EPMI may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the California ISO California Cap  Generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices  As a result at times such as during this weeks heat wave which caused blackouts in Las Vegas EPMI may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the West at a price below the California Cap  Because EPMI cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the California Cap to MPC we cannot purchase such energy on MPCs behalf for resale to MPC  

However in order to continue to serve MPCs needs at times of peak demand scarce supply and high prices EPMI proposes the following solution

	If EPMI is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the California Cap EPMI will strive to meet MPCs energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to MPC and for MPC to pay the generator directly 
	EPMI will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer who will be paying the generator directly for that energy
	EPMI will notify MPC of the identity of the seller along with the amount to be paid the seller and provide other information and assistance to enable MPC to pay the seller directly 
	All other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged
 
	We believe this proposal allows EPMI to continue to meet MPCs needs while complying with Federal law  If you have another proposal or would like to discuss this matter further please feel free to call either Christian Yoder at   or Steve Hall at    

Otherwise kindly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to this amendment by signing in the place provided below

Good Afternoon Ron

We just had a meeting with Bill Williams head of realtime trading in Portland to discuss some problems we are having with the realtime deals flowing to the Deal Confirmation system  Currently the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by realtime to reflect actual volumetric flow  price are not seen by the confirmation groups  One possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the realtime traders use deal entry to make all the changes  This solution will NOT work  If the realtime guys start changing the deals in deal entry the original negotiated deal will be lost  Also and more importantly the time to make all the changes for the realtime adjustments in Deal Entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing

Thanks  David Poston

Thanks JillI received a call from Charlie at EPE  If possible when you create a tag for EPE please use a slash instead of a semicolon in the Info Section in the Transaction Path  Apparently they are having problems uploading the tags into their system when semicolons are present  They are trying to fix this problem as soon as they can See below for more clarification


For example instead of GFSPV and LFS use GFSPV and LFS

KateFYI 

Although the El Paso CARP for  said there were no variances between it and the model not one of the totals in our model matched up with the totals on the CARP In addition the reconciliation model showed no variances on the purchase side and had no information on the sale side Several formulas in the model were either missing or incorrect and one preschedule purchase was missing although it was highlighted on the CARP printout 

Im not sure why this happened but whatever it is Im sure you guys didnt mean to send it to Kathy looking like this If you have any questions take a look at the CARP and model printout for  to see what Im talking about Thanks for your attention to this matter

Subject Busy Day with the LA Times


Investigative Reporters at the LA Times called me today Im not going
to say who but they are longtime pros dont worry about that asking
questions about the enormous amount of Out of Market OOM energy being
purchased by the ISO  They wanted to know if this was due to the
DWRCERS longterm contracts  They wanted to know if this is effecting
the realtime markets

The answers of course is yes  However I need you folks to help me
collect information from your settlements people substantiating what is
currently conjecture  That is the OOM costs are being allocated to
Scehduling Coordinators who are short in their hourly schedules  Your
generators may be buying realtime energy from the ISO thinking they
are getting a bargain only to discover  days later or more that an
enormous OOM charge has been allocated to your company  That is highway
robbery  Help me put some evidence to this

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom Calgary Operations Jeff Gossett  US Gas Risk and South America Operations Stacey White US Power Risk Leslie Reeves US Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements and Bob Superty US Gas Logistics 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston London and Singapore offices  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod who will now report directly to Beth Apollo 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale This will include Deal Capture Risk Analysis  Confirmations and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics Settlements and the Operational Analysis OA process and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems processes and controls and to consider alignment where it makes sense with existing EWS processes  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills with a focus on Deal Capture Risk Analysis and Confirmations and  Brenda Herod with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements

Todd A Perry
Enron North America	 work
 SW Salmon Street	 cell
WTC 		 fax
Portland OR 		toddperryenroncomCommenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the Chie
f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that 
you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink  Below is a C
liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at  
PM today  Attached is the complete work 

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of
 such refunds is not  billion as claimed by the State of California th
ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi
on dollars in an aggregate sum  At the same time while there are vast su
ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller
s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California 
 Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller
  The Chief Judge thinks not  Another notable quote  it is the opinio
n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has
 not and cannot be substantiated 

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July  which wa
s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate
 offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also 
rejected
 
Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October   for sales 
in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX  The Chief Judges recomme
ndations do not go beyond that date  Spot market sales are sales that a
re  hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de
livery

Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California 
believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what 
the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater
ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds 
involve factual disputes  Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty
pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to 
the methodology set forth below  Because of the urgent need for an answer 
to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule
  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot
ential refunds in this proceeding  However such a methodology may not be 
appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an 
afterthefact refund calculation    In any event sellers not using the m
ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede
d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund 
period

Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t
he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order 
to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS
Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O
ctober   through May   

Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso
ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro
vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit

Gas Cost  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based 
upon a daily spot gas price  In the event that the marginal unit is locat
ed in NP North of Path  the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a
nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the 
marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour  If 
the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path  the daily spot gas
 price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t
he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour  
The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina
ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver
y points  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the 
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol
idays

OM Adder  An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal
culated market clearing price 

Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma
rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s
ubtract from their respective refund calculation

Credit Adder The  percent adder should be included in the market clearin
g price for all transactions that occurred after January   when PGE 
and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy

Ancillary Services  Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service
 prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea
ltime imbalance energy market  Adjustment bids would also be treated the 
same as set forth in the June th Order

Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear  The Chief Judge r
ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat
ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the  nonemergen
cy requirement of the June th Order  To measure the amount that actual p
rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated


Offsets  Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref
und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char
ges for the refund period  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts
 due from buyers would be recalculated  Any refunds could then be offset a
gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their
 purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period

Interest  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless
 the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

KateThe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues Generally the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commissions April  Order and this report will highlight the differences

Geographical Scope  Mitigation is extended to cover all  western states

Term The term of the order will be extended to cover  summers  We expect the order to issue today  If so the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 

Spot Market Defined as sales of  hours or less transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery

Must Sell To prevent physical withholding the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time  All California generators even those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into the ISOs real time market   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted  

Price Mitigation  Expanded to be in place  hours per day  days per week Applies to all sellers including marketers and nonpublic utilities  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market based on marginal cost bids The proxy price formula is changed in several respects

		Gas price will be the average of the midpoint of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin SoCal Gas Large Packages and PGE City Gate
		OM increases from  to 
		Fuel startup and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO ie these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO but will not go into setting the proxy price
		Similarly a credit adder of  will apply only in CA 

A reserve deficiency in CA  or less also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above  During times when no reserve deficiency exists the mitigated price will be  of the highest price calculated in the last Stage  emergency  This price will be in effect until the next Stage  emergency  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy with justification during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose ie no cherry picking

Demand Side Management The plan originally set forth in the April  order is expected be removed in this order 

ISO Reporting ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA 

Comments Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes

Settlement Conference  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June  next Monday and the parties will have  days to settle  A report from the judge to the Commission is due  days thereafter for a total of  days

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality ISO board issues ISO scheduling penalty application and market based rate authorization  The Order is not finally issued as of yet and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order  We will keep you posted

continued to request reserves for several subsequent hours for the same
contingency Note also that MCC was called about the first contingency at
 but no request for reserves was made  

In listening to the voice recorder

all day with reliability problem reports and requesting operating reserves
Finally he was directed to call the Dittmer generation dispatcher  Mark
said he had fuel problems and needed reserves  He also wanted to know who
to call for reporting hourly actual generation because we told him that the
hourly reporting had stopped at   Seems they were calling Munro with
this information also

use operating reserves only through HE due the time of the event being

Id be more than happy to maintain a database of El Paso discrepancies for Settlements to access on a daily basis however Id like to get a little more clarity on exactly what the goal is with this reconciliation model My impression is that it compares volumes and price in the El Paso model with volumes and price in Enpower Heres what we currently do The traders reconcile the model to Enpower each night then write the variances on a hard copy of the CARP report Kathy calls me if there are any differences between the model and actuals in the morning Therefore you wont see discrepancies in physical flow in this reconciliation model Again I want to make sure were all getting what we need out of this model

Our phone lines computers and cell phones were down    Additionally   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown

One of our service customers  Teco  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas   Geir was contacted via satellite phone
He sold  megawatts each hour to AEP   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price
He maintained good  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday    
Most importantly  this was a seamless transaction to the customer

I have one more thing to add to the list of Enpower requests

Deals done under the EPMI Short Term West Hourly desk do not need to be confirmed The Real Time traders know they need to check No in the Confirmation box in Deal Entry however its one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked It occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of Real Time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed  and unnecessarily confusing counterparties  if we could make No confirmation an automatic default for all deals entered under the Short Term West Hourly book 

I cant think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change but lets discuss that during the next Enpower meeting Please let me know what we can do to get this implemented

When running the Confirm function
I was able to print the error log which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors
The routing speed was still very good

What needs improvement
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production The rockies sheet alone took  hours to upload the Mid C sheet took over two hours I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue I will continue uploading today and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm I got this error message ERRORAccess violation at address EDE in module PreSchedWSexe Read of address 
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet I used another half hour fixing the errors and rerunning the sheet
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs nonphysical Everything shows nonphysical
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points

Question Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now  the weakness with having the path show from transmission   etc is it does not give the PORPOD or the firmness of the transmission  
 The way a path should look is like this SRPPVEAPSTPVWW O FWALCTWWMEAD O MNFEPMINEVP  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be   SRPPVEAPSWALCNEVP  This is incomplete information

OR would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells Instead of APS  put APSTPVWW and in the OASIS cell put  F


In Path Confirmation

What worked
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them The save takes too long but it worked


What still needs work
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number Would a different tag logic work instead of PWX Tag   show  PWX TAG Some marketers use letters for tags
The cell with the path in the expanded view must autosize to contain all of the path
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passedUpstreamSupplyETransTransTransMarketDownstreamRight now some run together 
The path cut needs work it is cumbersome unclear on some entry requirements and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it This app seems like guesswork

New path needs work as well  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field like in build route selection not a first letter drop down list
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical It should mimic the deal entry list
	The new record should be three tiered  Supply first then marketboth mandatory entry then transmission as an optional third To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems
	How are these new records going to be routed
	Also our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut




I will continue testing tomorrow the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work


We are getting there I am very encouraged

Lets try something a little bit different regarding Real Time deal disputes

When Virginia and Mike receive a dispute from Houston theyll file the pertinent information in a drawer marked DMS to the right of my desk in a folder with your name on it Please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many Sometime over the course of your shift take a minute to address the discrepancy make strides to resolve it If it happens to be more complicated than an intrashift fix talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution pull tapes pull our hair out etc

The most important step of this new procedure is postop  TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOUVE DONE Sign the corresponding DMS sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back Return it to Virginia Mike or me Whatever you do dont leave without a trace

Id like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan so feedback is welcome In the meantime this procedure will be effective immediately Some of you already have disputes in your filesEnjoy

Dear Traders and Schedulers

  The following information is FYI  Diana Scholtes may have given you this information already but I just spoke with Corrine at BPA and I think that we can lessen our exposure to hefty charges with the following information

  Please be advised that BPA carries an Unauthorized Increase charge for the use of transmission that is not properly reserved  That charge is  PER MW
When calling in for transmission especially RealTime please be careful when using our account numbers OASIS numbers and contract numbers  I suggest that when you use the account number that you review the structure of the product in that account with the BPA tranny person ie confirm that you are requesting hourly nonfirm on the DC Intertie SN if that is what you intend to reserve  

  Thus far we have avoided these  charges by splitting some other costs with BPA  Lets just be careful in the future so that we dont get hit big

  Please let me know if you have any questions

  Thanks

Both for mw on Lightload for   I have made a tag  for the LA to PGE path  It was made as a preschedule tag but due to the lateness of it BPA may deny it just because they can  If that happens EPMI realtime will have to make a realtime tag  You can use my tag as a template  Late breaking news  my tag went undelivered due to communication failure at PGE so I faxed the tag to all the counterparties  Mirant has made tag  for the IPCO to NP path  

All counterparties have been called as of  and are aware that these schedules are going realtime  that is their real time groups will call the schedules in to BPA  EPMI realtime will have to make sure this gets done with a reminder phone call to our counterparties

I have spoken with PGEDonna AEPPeggy MirantEmily and IPCOPerry  CAES Conagra had already gone home for the day and has no realtime

KateVirgina and Bill

During our monthend processes I have researched deal   The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE   Originally the deal liquidated with HE MWh HEMWh  and HE MWh but on  the volume for HE was zeroed out in scheduling which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE back

I have one question on this months PMA and some questions from last month  First for deal  this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  Are we being charged for each counterparty again like EES and STCali last month if so we need to fix this flawed tool 

Second for last month we determined that the WBOM book needs a  PMA for change in price  The appropriate price is in Enpower but the revenue has never appeared Deal  Remember this deal was originally input as a buy at  and a sell at  and liquidated at these prices The deal is now at  and   What do we need to do to get this trued up

	SD has all of its power offered into the Pool at   Thats MW    Therefore you shouldnt have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down

	Our telephone line  has been forwarded to your line for the required hours  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line

	The number for the plant is  and the number for the power pool is   

	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed  This most likely wont happen  In case it does the site is wwwpowerpoolabca  You must Login top right hand corner as John A Zufferli  Click on ETS then Submission  You can then restate the offers of SD and SD as required

Hi Jake and the rest of you

I went there too rd and Powell and found that no one was there
Beautiful open field nets and no one to kick it around with  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at   I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brads team would be there  Not sure what
happened I guess Brads Team either took the week off  moved or changed
times If any one sees him ask what is going on I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service I also went over to
Madison High on th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
email regarding practice  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night  to  at Oregon Episcopal School
OES to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks  Is that still ok Justin or Adam   Let us know  Sorry about the no

Subject Documenting CAISOs purchases from CERSDWR


It may be easier to document than I thought

Anjali Sheffrins July report shows data for June p   The majority
of real time purchases are from CERSDWR and the price for OOM is
substantially higher than other RT power  The need for OOM greatly
diminished begining in late May yet CAISO bought most of its RT power

ISO Market Participants
In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC June  order the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ISO was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all instate load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs  In compliance the ISO filed on July   proposed Tariff
revisions to develop
	a rate for the emission allowance charge 
	an escrow account for monies collected 
	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees and 
	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs  
In a Market Notice posted on August   the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at httpwwwcaisocomdocshtml
httpwwwcaisocomdocshtml 
The June  FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude startup fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price and instead to
pay generators for such startup fuel costs in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees  In a Market Notice posted on
August   the ISO published the initial startup fuel charge rate
The ISO has modified the previously posted startup fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this
rate  This information is also posted at

My response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in  If they have a bid
in they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to FERC  Right
Who do they send cost justification to

 K

 I wanted to document what just happened on receiving a dispatch
 instruction from the ISO for Harbor Cogen harbgnunits   At 
 we received a dispatch instruction from he ISO due to the Stage 
 emergency  The request was for  MW from Tosco and  MW from Harbor


 As you know we are no longer the SC for Tosco and have sent you the
 required documentation  Can you make sure the ISO has this in their
 system

 With respect to Harbor we were running  MW and were incd 
 indicating a request for a total of  MW  We already had an approved
 outage request from the ISO as indicated by the fax I sent you
 indicating that Harbor only had  MW available  So the ISO should
 only have been able to dispatch  MW

 We initially declined the dispatch instruction from the ISO due to the
 errors the ISO made and the confusion it caused us  We immediately
 hit the phones to clarify the facts and subsequently incd
 generation to  MW by   Why did the ISO dispatch group not have
 our outage request indicating a maximum of  MW

 We believe we have completely responded to the ISOs instruction and
 should have no penalty charges  Please let me know the settlement
 implications of this confusion event

 Thanks

 Chris

I agree with Bills assessment as shown in the attachment  Prior to submitting bids Vol Mgmt needs to know the agreed upon shared savings between EPMI and the specific customers so we can set up our tools to capture these correctly  Please stop by to discuss

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding  From a RealTime standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns  Overall this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement  Feel free to see me with questions

The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday There were several IT teams your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audiovideo streaming services

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October  which was set by business Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug  today This didnt provide much time for preparation and testing During the troubleshooting for each of your sites the Network team Scott Shishido and George Nguyen were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance I will be meeting with the Web Edward Ray and Network Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting

 Hi Green Roomers
 
 The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
 have been posted to the GPSD website at
 httpwwwgpsdsoccercom
 You will be surprised to learn like I was that we were not promoted to
the
 st division  It seems that the league has decided to keep us in nd even
 though I registered for and said we would accept the promotion to st
 division in order to be eligible for the championship    
 
 Our first game is on Sunday Sept th at Delta Park  NE of Strasser at
   All of the rest of the games in the  game season will also be at
  and will occur every Sunday between Sept th and November th with
 the exception of Sunday October st when we have a bye  We then will
have
 a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again
 Right
 
 Dont forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or
are
 new to the team  You update or get a player card at the OASA league
office
 off of Highway  at the Sylvan exit  They do have odd hours so call them
 before you head up there
 
 Anyway that is enough from me  See you soon out on the soccer pitch

I guess its a comment on our times when the height of a persons morality

		tycho pennyarcade Sept URGENT

    WASHINGTON AP   Federal regulators voted Monday to order price
restraints on electricity sales across the West but not the
stringent costbased controls sought by California
    The  vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
followed intense pressure not only from California Gov Gray Davis
and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House
Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could
affect the  election
    FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order effective through
September  will benefit consumers but also will provide
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs
    The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April
on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand
periods when blackouts were threatened

For WSCC Outages and West Realtime databases if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following

If this deal was zeroed out and it has been after the fact then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC the other side of the deal

Virgina and Bill

During our monthend processes I have researched deal   The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE   Originally the deal liquidated with HE MWh HEMWh  and HE MWh but on  the volume for HE was zeroed out in scheduling which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE back

I have one question on this months PMA and some questions from last month  First for deal  this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  Are we being charged for each counterparty again like EES and STCali last month if so we need to fix this flawed tool 

Second for last month we determined that the WBOM book needs a  PMA for change in price  The appropriate price is in Enpower but the revenue has never appeared Deal  Remember this deal was originally input as a buy at  and a sell at  and liquidated at these prices The deal is now at  and   What do we need to do to get this trued up
Please come see me with questions

This evening Friday  you will need to call the ISO realtime desk to have them change Harbor Cogens Pmax  This morning we had them change it from mw to mw through HE  We did this because we made a sale through HE with the assumption that their Pmax was mw when in fact the ISO had it at mw

So please call the ISO realtime desk this evening to have them change Harbors Pmax from mw back to mw

Granted I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present
an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list I also favor the
move to D  I think better competition will be more fun provided that
we field a full team speaking mostly at myself here on a consistent
basis  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the
Fall season I also know another playerNate Stanton he has played with
a few of us in indoorwho is interested in playing and is a bit quicker
and better than myself  So for what its worth  D all the way

 Hello all

 Considering the circumstances if we dont move up I think we should
 just
 move
 up to the first division As a lover of european soccer I enjoy the
 promotionrelegation system It is a great way for leagues to equalize
 competition So we should just take it in the gut and toughin up and
 move
 to
 the st Itll be fun and competitive Maybe itll give us more
 motivation
 to
 stay focused as a team Im all for it Afterall we deserve it We
 earned
 this
 move I dont want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to
 stay in

 But this does mean that it wouldnt hurt to have a few more good
 players
 join
 us So if you know of anyone really good have him join

 need  you to send me a check ASAP  My address is  SW Dakota Drive

 some
  games starting on September th

 The other issue I need you to ponder is st Division vs nd Division
 I
 know at our last game we decided to stay in nd but what I did not
 know at
 the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
 championship for  years if we are st or nd in our league since we
 did
 not promote our team to st division  I guess one way around this is
 to
 change our name and Manager nay volunteers and then I doubt the
 league
 would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room
 team
 or just to try out st division and see how it goes and try and get a
 few
 more power players to make us even better   Please respond to me by
 telling

 Over the past few weeks the real time desk has had several cuts on schedule
s that have involved Mirant in the Southwest  I thought that I should brin
g it to all of your attention that Mirant has not been fulfilling their obl
igation to resupply cut schedules In several instances Mirant is also  no
t telling any of the downstream counter parties until after the hour of the
 cut  This evening  Steve and I had four separate schedules in which Miran
t was cut by PAC transmission for several hours  In each of these cases Mi
rant was unwilling to resupply and was unwilling to contact the downstream
 counter parties  It appears to me that they dont want to take the time t
o resupply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules  On t
hree of these schedules I had to negotiate a book out for Mirant and on one
 I was able to resupply  In all of the recent cuts I have dealt with them
 on they have acted in a similar manner  After discussing this issue with 
Cara she thought it would be prudent to pass this information along to all
 of you  If you have any further questions about this issue please feel fr
ee to contact me After the Day ahead market ran the  branch group COI TTC Path  in the N
to S direction was changed from  MW to  MW and in the S to N
direction from  MW to  MW and the branch group PDCI path  in the
N to S direction from  MW to  MW and in the S to N direction from
 to  MW all for HEs  through  for operating day 
The reasons for the change is due to completion of line work The first
applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE  The ISO
will update you of any changes in line rating status Sent by Market
Operations inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk

PaulCara

First of all thanks for your input  

Regarding the new issues with path confirmation most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily  Vish is already working on them  
Concerning the colors there are three sets of colors representing market supply and transmission  I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking  This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application

Regarding PreSchedule adding print capability to the error log should be no problem  Also adding check for errors functionality will be done  
Concerning Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips either term or schedule for a deal but the strips have different delivery points  The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use  I will confirm this

We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name  I may have both the code and description displayed  I believe Corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records Corry can you confirm this

The information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days but if you have more please send it

Thanks
Will

Subject	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June th  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group Once COB is added we will have pretty much an average daily volume

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C     File MidCJunepsc  


In Preschedule Workspace

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of  lines into the Path confirmation The rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so I marked them for routing only  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and I have to make notes on what is wrong Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwards

Routing functionality question  If we change a delivery point in scheduling BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point  These types of deals route now I would like to duplicate that existing functionality I did get an error message on those lines Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points Please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line  thru  but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered

The routing speed is EXCELLENT One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower The megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging My Palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower short name to something that is workable  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable 

Yesterday I identified several problems

 The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp

 The Alias list is not functioning properly  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp

 Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by line


Today I am finding the following

  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point  These fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur

I am not allowed to sort by Global ID  even though global IDs are populated there My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys

 Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over  minutes  This is to long to be practical in production for real time I would like to see this time go to  seconds or less

  All paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet

 The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable Variations of the beige color are easier to read

 The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first and then populate the cut This is a bit different than we discussed  My plan is to take this as far as I can and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final tweaking

 I also cannot sort by tag number  We need that



Thank you all for your work on this it is really looking good 
I have to schedule on Monday but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks

Its all in the latest eBiz  Go to homeenroncom click Publications then click eBiz and eBiz April  To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron Americas Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital we have decided to create a Capital Book The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas with any form of capital requirement are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets Therefore on any assets currently held within each business area the capital charge will remain at  Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of  Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous  across the board charge Transactions which are structured off balance sheet but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron Americas overall credit capacity

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction As noted above the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost

By sending marketbased capital pricing signals internally Enron Americas sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to

Just a reminder that when entering a wheel the Interchange ID must be the same for the import and export  When the Import is labeled as EPMICISO and the Export as CISOEPMI the ISO views these as unique imports and exports  They will not be linked together for a wheel thus causing ancillary services charges to occur  

Thank youAs the southwest heats up or the ISO goes into stages of emergency or path  is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows

  NW Utility to PAC on BPAT
  PACW to IPCTEnterpriseENPR on PACT
  IPCENPR to PACTBorah BradyBOBR on IPCT
  IPCBOBR to Four CornersFC on PACT
  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead

Im not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is mw of room on this path


Enjoy

SlingerHey Guys 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more The tie is only good for MW

 Either do a export from SP to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at SilverpeakFrom PV or FC
 Buy transmission from SPP from  wwwswoasiscom  CONTROL TO HILLTOP  onpeak  offpeak
 Buy transmission from PAC from MAL TO MAL 
 Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink Account numbers below

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra



Also do not sell to a marketerespecially POWEREX without sleeving We do not want anybody else to know about the path If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing MW into Cali going the opposite way of us way  

It is available hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can
If you have any questions over the weekend call me

GeirHey Guys 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZPNP BuyResale on a Realtime basis We are not doing a profit split this time we are paying them MW instead This basically enables us to shift MW across PATH and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path This is a sweet strategy when the SPNP spread is there and PATH is congested NCPAs capacity is MW but I would not recommend doing more than MW There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it WESCO especially So by doing only  MW we do not remind them of NCPA 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour 

IN CAPS
We sell to NCPA in ZP  
We buy from NCPA in NP

We can buy SP to fill our ZP sale we just shift the load from SP to ZP so enter a EPMI CALPOOL
PGE is NCPAs SC so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call



NCPAs tel  
PGE tel   

If you guys have any questions  just ask me

EPMI made  marketing fees from Grays Paper for March Have you done the  split annuity yet

LesHey Guys 

We have a new way to export from NP up to the Northwest Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border There is currently MW NonFirm Hourly transmission available on the tie

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS Offerings The path name you need to check is WPPWCRAGPACW Make sure you pick Hourly nonfirm 

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCADCRAGVW by the CISO 


Procedure
Export at Cascade from the CISO 
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System 

Transmission costthrough PAC is only 

I know the NPMIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past It does on the other hand give us another option

Thank you so much for writing back to me I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you  How are things going  We have so much catching up to do  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations  I hope all is going wonderful with you  Things here are great  I am almost done with my second year of school only  more weeks  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last  years and I think I passed  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people  Ill actually be in Seattle all of August and September so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug
How is work  Are you still doing the same job  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that  In fact that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked but I know nothing about it  are you living by yourself in a condo a home an apartment  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about  Im sure there is
Well I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today and unfortunately I must go  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up
I have missed you my friend take care

Hey there Bill

I thought Id drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself
Your buddy Brendan has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July  I do have a college friend out there who I hope to
locate so you might not have to be stuck with me 

Anyhow Im Nikki  Id go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo  Congratulations  I
cant wait to have a place of my own  Apartment life is horrible  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say hi  Im really serious  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit apartment life is a good way to get to know
people

I dont know what Brendan has told you about me but heres the story  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here  I need trees and green
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box
Where theres not dirt theres piles of crap  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree

So to say the least Im a little stir crazy for a new environment  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach California  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year  Then Im moving to Oregon  Ive never
visited or anything Im just drawn there  To be perfectly honest its
because of the two movies Goonies and Kindergarten Cop  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since  Nows my
chance  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my masters in Public Health Administration or my MBA  Well see
which fits me best later  I dont feel that at  I can really decide the
best avenue for the next  years of my career so Im waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates iteneraries etc and so forth
Im a very spontaneous type of person I dont really do planning and
scheduling  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun  Its better
that way  Life can be too organized

Well now that Ive given you a short introductionhaha  Id love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July
Dont worry if they change I wont hold ya to them  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the th through the th of July IF I dont go
to Calgary Canada  Currently Im planning as many trips as I possibly can
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I dont have a husband and kids to take care of 

Hope to hear from you soon
Nikki

Congressional Republicans Draft Energy Bill to Aid the West
Rep Joe Barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding 
energy markets in the Western United States via funding for improvements in
 Californias constrained transmission line SP and directing federal dis
aster officials to prepare for power outages  The move by Republicans came
 as Democratic criticism of the Bush administrations response to the Calif
ornia power crisis intensified Wednesday  Although the bill will not conta
in the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans Barton 
said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committe
e deliberations  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a
 range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules subject to a governor
s request increasing federal energy assistance to lowincome consumers f
iring up mothballed power plants and directing federal facilities to reduc
e energy use by   Additionally the bill would grant governors the flex
ibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to tempor
arily keep operating during emergencies
All of us are aware of the energy crisis confronting us and the situation might get a lot worse this summer  PGE has taken actions to reduce energy consumption eg decreasing the amount of lighting within the building  

In the spirit of energy conservation Chris Calger and I are asking that you turn off your monitors each day  You do not need to log out of your computers to do thissimply press the monitor off button  If you have any questions about how to turn off your monitors check with Dave Steiner in our IT Department

MimeVersion 
ContentType multipartmixed boundaryDBCABDE

FYI  Attached is a complaint filed by CARE on April  against BC Hydro Powerex Mirant and BPA with the LADWP thrown in as an unnamed respondent  The complaint is principally directed against BC Hydro and Powerex  It essentially accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in BC and transmission capacity reserved by Powerex on the BPA system to COB and NOB to withhold power during a period of peak demand to contrive a shortage and test their market power  CARE accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of violating Section  of the FPA state and federal antitrust laws the civil rights of Californians under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  and NAFTA

The complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts  The evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the YAHOO Message Board by an unnamed power trader in Spokane we think it is an Avista trader selected transmission data from the ISO the LA Times article of April   regarding the ISOs report on Powerex BPA and LADWP the ISO report itself and BC Hydros residential rate schedule  CARE requests FERC to initiate an investigation seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want FERC to have the Secretary of DOE declare an emergency under Section c of the FPA and compel deliveries of electricity

FERC has noticed the complaint and has established May  as the due date for interventions and responses

Subject	West VAR

the numbers being generated for the wests var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations  for example the ltnw book has a grant total of  MWh from now through September OnPeak and  MWh from now through September OffPeak  the var report shows mike with  million of var  about  million of it coming between now and september  we have a total var of  million with about  million between now and september  by my rough calculations we would have to have the entire curve move roughly MWh in one day for this var to be accurate  that means that once every  days the entire summer curve  peak and offpeak  would have to move in excess of MWh  i might add that we are short q which im not giving us any credit for as an offset 

i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books  i just dont think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery  we see the same thing with option valuations  we see option model valuations eg transmission spread options going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality  similarly the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches

bottom line  i need to know what you want us to do  we are chewing up a lot of var  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldnt necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the model happy
I will be taking Tuesday and Friday of this week off  I will be at home and available by cell phone  If needed I will be able to come into the office for a short period of timefor your reading pleasure

If you have any question please give me a call on the West short term services desk

Regards

Bert MeyersWe had an issue with a PSCO schedule at FC  for HE   Craig sold PSCO
  mw at the  bus  It was not specified which bus it was to be deliver
ed to  There was a tag put out and it was made by us and has PSCO listed a
s the PSE on the transmission from the  bus to the  bus  It was deni
ed so that does not mean much  I had a lengthy discussion with PSCO on thi
s around am on the thturret   You will want to listen to the W
HOLE conversation since we take several different directions throughout the
 conversation  Bert also had a prior discussion with them about  minutes 
earlier on turret   Craig should have done the deal between am and 
 am  I finally got PSCO to take responsibility for the schedule in a sec
ond discussion at am  They are supposed to put in a transmission reque
st after the fact for HE   They claimed on the last phone call that Craig
 did not say until further and they will not accept responsibility for HE
   He is supposed to pull tapes and get back to me but of course I have n
o faith in PSCO and am writing this now since Im sure you will hear on th
e tapes the guy knows that he is wrong and wants to cover it up and hope s
ettlements doesnt get after him

thanks

Lisa Gang wanted me to tell the night shift that tag   is not a good tag  We tried to cancel it but for some reason WALC denied our cancel request  Cara already spoke to Leon  PAC regarding this issue  The reason this tag is not a good tag is the tranny request was duplicated in another tag  which is a good tag  If you have any questions please call Cara on her cell phone

Bert MeyersTo Whom it may concern

Tag  was cut by  MW for HE  and HE   Wally  NEVP said he heard
 of the cut   on  but he neglected to call us and tell us abo
ut the cut  The reason for the cut was PAC nonfirm tranny being cut that 
PSCO bought  However they sold us a firm product  PNM didnt know about t
he cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing po
wer on the grid Approx time of notification   We booked out with P
SCO and PNM for HE  and HE  on the C part of the transaction deals
  and   For HE   MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO a
nd PNM on the C piece of the transaction deals  and   PS
CO resupplied the power for HE  from SRP  Mead    The same thing hap
pened for HE  as HE   SRP resupplied  the power for HE   I bought b
ack for HE  from PSCO  C and resold the power to SRP  The deals are
 in the RT Inc sheet for the th of June  After the fact I spoke with R
yan  PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE  and HE 
 on the MEAD  part of the transaction  on Kate Symes Phone


Please Call with question
