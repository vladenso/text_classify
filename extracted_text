Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

I made a few suggested revisions in the attached tag time table.  BPAT is
supportive of the change to remove the preschedule flag and also to use the
LCA prevailing time.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

Subject: FW: Possible new E-tag time table


Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.

If it works at all for the group - June 27th works great for me as I would already be in Portland and can attend this type of a meeting.  None of the other dates would work for me.

> Bob,
Sorry for the late response, I've been gone the last 10 days. I will not be
able to make the meeting on June 27. I do like Jack Dempsey's proposal. I'm
not sure I completely understand Mons' reasoning, but I believe the PSE
submission deadline should be left at 30 minutes for the following 2
reasons:

1. 3A1 is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and
excluding the ramp time. If we change it to read "20 minutes prior
    to start" that would allow a tag to be submitted at 40 after.

2. If the 20 minutes verbage is to be used, then the the remaining verbage
defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will
    need to be removed.

It was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the real-time
deadline at :30 after.

However, I still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to
the new BP's being put forth by the ESC/ESTF. Are we going to take into
account the BP's that the ECS/ESTF have put out/being commented on? The
schedule process BP has several ramping/timing changes, as well as frag
tags. They aren't asking whether or not we should adopt Eastern Connection
timelines, they're just doing it.

Personally, I don't think the majority of the WSCC's units can handle a 10
minute ramp, and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude
to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts.
However, that is being proposed.

I would appreciate someone else's opinion on where the proposed BP's fit in
with our goal.

I added comment #5 for clarification.

Also, did the group decide to recommend that all tags be submitted in PPT?  If so, then comment #1 is incorrect and would need to be changed to PPT.

Bob Harshbarger

 - tag time table draft_rev2.doc Based on what I've seen so far, looks like June 27th.

Based on that, I have tentatively booked a room 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at
the PDX Conference Center, Portland, OR.  If you haven't been there before,
there's diagram/map at:

http://portlandairportpdx.com/web_pop/CONFER.HTM

Some of the items for an agenda:
*	Elimination of preschedule flag
*	Time table times refer to prevailing time of the sink/load control
area
*	Preschedule items
*	Real-time items

There are more specific items, I just haven't had enough coffee yet.  A real
agenda out next week.

206.604.3251 (cell)	Has anyone, or everyone, read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by NERC on Tuesday? It is ESC's Scheduling and Approval
Practices submitted by the Multiple Task Groups - Scheduling Process,
Approval, Schedule Timing, Granularity and Ramping Task Groups.
	Specifically, they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
10-minute straddle ramp (:55 to :05). In addition, they're recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter (as already exists at :15, :30,
:45) with a 10 minute ramp. Their reasoning is, and this is a quote, "large
generators that require longer Ramp times (e.g. 20 or 30 minutes), could
partially ramp for 10 minutes across the schedule start, then finish with
another 10-minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp.
This would accommodate areas such as Florida and WSCC, where longer ramp
times are needed."
	Their asking for feedback for the public posting. This proposal has

Based on what I've seen so far, looks like June 27th.

Based on that, I have tentatively booked a room 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at
the PDX Conference Center, Portland, OR.  If you haven't been there before,
there's diagram/map at:

http://portlandairportpdx.com/web_pop/CONFER.HTM

Some of the items for an agenda:
*	Elimination of preschedule flag
*	Time table times refer to prevailing time of the sink/load control
area
*	Preschedule items
*	Real-time items

There are more specific items, I just haven't had enough coffee yet.  A real
agenda out next week.

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

425.882.4643 (desk)
206.604.3251 (cell)Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:  		Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:		8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.

It should take no longer than 15 minutes.

Please contact me with any questions you may have in the mean time.

Virginia



Dear Bill,

Below please find a voice recording of a tape that I have pulled.  I think this is a good example of a clear re-cap, which comes in handy and leaves no question as to price, volume, or time.

Thanks,

Virginia


 Dear Traders,

Here are a couple of things I've thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute.  Please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research. 

1.) All notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them.  Notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders' interpretation.

2.) Can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times?  I often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason.  

3.) One thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the Inc sheets, however, I still sometimes find that the trader's notes and the Inc sheets or the El Paso Model don't match.  At that point, I don't know which one to go by.  I need to be sure that I can trust the accuracy of the Inc sheets as the end-all.

4.) Please make sure that all real-time deals or real-time extended deals are getting routed.  I've come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate.  It also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes.

5.) Please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled.  I've seen a few deals that are in the traders' notebooks, but that haven't been entered in EnPower.  You know the result.

6.) CUTS (need I say more) ...are a mess.  I really really need to see notes on every cut!!!!!  This means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database AND notes in deal scheduling ! 
When a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut, I need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note.  Many of my DMS's could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in EnPower (this means I found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in EnPower).  I specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule:  Where did resupply come from (deal # too)?  Was it a bookout (deal # too)?  What's the resupply price?  Who at the counterparty did our trader talk to?  What is the reason for the cut?  And please initial your notes so that if I have a question about them, I know who to ask.
You can never make too many notes!!

One thing to remember is that Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, and Lotus Notes do not communicate with each other, so though it is a grueling task, every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places.  (it's called copy and paste)

If we can keep these things in mind, I think we will have fewer disputes in the future.  And when we do have disputes, I'll be able to figure them out in a more timely manner.  

Thanks for your attention to these things.  I look forward to bugging you less in the future.

This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;

1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.

2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who  
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.  

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.  

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.

Cara Semperger
West Power Scheduling
503/464-3814

There is a 25 mw light load schedule that Aquila Canada is generating and AVA sinks at there system.   The schedule is going real-time because Aquila reported the transmission incorrectly to BPA transmission group.  We bought from Aquila Deal # 508908.1 and sold to WWP Deal # 162508.1.  Please refer to Aquila tag numbers #167799 and #167797.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.  

Thanks,
Stacy
(503) 807-7861WHEN THEY ARE MAKING TAGS, THEY ARE IDAC01,

When we tag them, and they are sinking, they are still IPCM01
We are 7 MW long all hours at Montana System,  which is our buy from MPC, deal number 615780.1

The upstream is PSEI-DUKE-WWP-MPCO.

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule, and that tag is 23795.

When we get close to HE 0100 on Monday, that Tag needs to go away, and the energy needs to be sold.

Please don't say it was a false preschedule, just say that it was 'unexpectedly ramped down' or something.

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

CaraThe following day ahead tag# 24395 for the 11th was denied by WACM because it was submitted after the 3:00pdt tag deadline.  Tag# 24365 was the predecessor and was approved by WACM.  Still, WACM refuses to approve TAG#24395.  Please copy this tag and submit it as a real-time schedule on the 11th.  Sorry for the inconvenience I received ZERO cooperation from the control areas.   Please check out with each control area when submitting the new tag.  Per Mary at WACM, I could not tag this schedule day ahead.  

Thanks,
Stacy

Subject:=09Loss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers:

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area (WACM) has just implemented=
 a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a =
reminder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be complete=
d.

1.  Please ensure that "WACM" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is importan=
t as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli=
vered.
2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words "WACM Losses".  If the ta=
gs are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate =
the date; i.e., "WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY".
3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t=
o WACM.
4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish=
ed same day, next week, same profile.
5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a=
 single tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount=
 of loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu=
led transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due =
from day -7.

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new schedulin=
g software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction los=
s energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effe=
ct that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to=
 you immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send a=
n e-mail.

(970) 461-7440Preschedule had a heck-u-va day on Friday.  Due to many problems, some of our tags were not completed until after the 3pm preschedule deadline.  Apparently, some of our counterparties automatically deny late tags, though they may be corrections of tags made prior to the deadline.  In any case, we have a list of tags that have been submitted as real-time tags and the schedules should be treated such.  The tags and paths are as follows:

Thanks, Donald.

PS.  Lisa will be adding to this list with a following note.Our upstream is Dynegy deal # 570332.1 Mid C HLH

Our Downstream is WWP deal # 339963.1

The path:

West Kootenai (G)-BCH(T)JUANITA/BCUS O#M335781A-WKPL-DYPMI-SNPD(T)BPA(T)BCUS/AVA O#96062 HNF-DYPMI-EPMI-WWP  

MONTH LONG TAG 26019

HE 0700-0800 we are warned by SNPD that the transmission MAY BE curtailed to Zero.

When I spoke with Susan at WWP she finds this very suspicious, as it was described to her as a "West of Hatwai" problem she is suspicious of this and is investigating.


Please get with DYPMI and get their re-supplied transmission before this schedule flows in the morning.

There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23299) and PGE sinks at system.   The schedule is going real-time because BPA transmission group did not build the proper account for this path.  We bought from BPA Deal # 308337.1 and sold to EPME Deal # 489735.1.  Please refer to EPME tag number #10416.  I spoke with Matt at BPA Power side who agreed this was a good schedule.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.   

Thanks,

Cara.

I'm going home for the weekend and I thought I would let you know the
procedure to follow to get your schedules at MEAD scheduled real time.

These are the schedules that are in as a preschedule:
	TAG   0025726
	TAG   0025777
	MSCGO1 TAG MSCI113

The left over mw's, after these tags,  will all have to be submitted as a
realtime tag NO EARLIER THAN 4 HOURS BEFORE THE SCHEDULE RUNS.

You will have to call PSCO marketing realtime desk to tell them what you new
tags will be  303-308-6175.  They have a heads up from me as to what you
will call about.  If you do not call,  THEY WILL NOT PUT THE SCHEDULE IN, WE
WILL NOT GENERATE.

I understand EPMI's problem today.  I've been there when I worked for MIECO.
Our control area that we turn all our schedules into are kind of hard to
work with sometimes.  It is up to them weather or not a schedule gets put in
as a preschedule.  Before they go home every night, they must check out
preschedules with their adjacent control areas.  Since they work on an
hourly basis, and don't get bonuses,  they are not always willing to stick
around and wait on late tags.  Between 3:00pm and 4:00pm MDT, they take the
tags they have and start to check out with them.  Everything else must be
put in real time.  This sometimes makes our jobs harder but there is nothing
I can do about it.  I hope everything else goes well and these schedules get
put in.

All parties are aware that this schedule will exist in real time, and IPCO is taking responsibility to make sure it is tagged.

Please call BPA and IPCO before HE0700 to make sure this schedule is still going to work.

See me if you have any questions.

We had problems getting the tag approved.  This is a good path and should flow.  Both the generating and load control areas have a copy of this tag and have agreed to implement this schedule real-time even if the tag is denied.  I spoke with Brandi at WACM (970) 461-7277 and Theresa at WALC (602) 352-2552.  

If there are any issues regarding how the load PSE should be represented on the tag, John Dake at WALC said the CRSPM1 was the appropriate PSE for these tags and there is no reason the schedule should be denied.   

You can reach me on my cell at 807-7861 if you have any additional questions.  There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23928) and SPP sinks at Humbolt.   The schedule is going real-time because SPP reported the transmission incorrectly to AVA transmission group.  We bought from BPA Deal # 486140.1 and sold to SPP Deal # 610573.1.  Please refer to SPP tag number #2848.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.

 This schedule was not called in properly to BPA, and is therefore going real time:

Kysa,  Yesterday Tradespark told me that they are now charging a flat fee of $10.00 for all daily (1-2 days) deals.  I just want to make sure Chris Mallory is aware of this and he approves.

Hi Kysa,

Can you please ask Chris Mallory what the fees are for the Tradespark deals because they are saying all deals are $.01 and we show $.0075..

														STCA buys 50 MW @ sp for $61.44 deal number 680344

Kysa M. Alport
Enron North America
503-464-7486After consulting with our California Scheduling team to determine why 5/12 volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours, I have revised my sheet, and I think you'll find this new one more fitting....

 		
Also, the 5/1 sheet has been revised slightly - namely, the NP-15 transmission column. Daniel, per our conversation this morning, the NP-15 and SP-15 on peak prices happened to be the same on this day, so they are correct as you see them in the sheet.

Please call me with questions.

Thanks,
Kate
503-464-7486Mr. Williams III your deal number for the swap is 666307, 25 MW for $49.88.

							Good Morning

If you have recently traded with Bloomberg (within the week) and have negotiated a broker fee other than $15 I would like to know.  Confirms has been changing prices that are greater or less than $15 to the usual bro fee of $15 which may be incorrect.  Thanks for your help.

I have consolidated my notebook w/ the West Service notebook.  You will find the cash sheets in front of the west service inf0rmation.  Also, there are two new notebooks.  One says Schedule in red and the other says Schedule in blue.

														I've killed the Cal-Imbalance deal I entered under Short Term West BOM for 5/14 - 609174 - as well as the inter-desk swap between STCA and West BOM - 609240.

I double-checked Real Time Position Manager and the Forward Obligations report for this day, and all looks fine. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it remains that way until tomorrow morning. 

Please let me know if you have questions.

														Daniel & Judy -
	Please note - I have adjusted 5/1 to reflect the load EES reported to EPMI for that day. I just received your sheet from Michael (Spruiell) today, and didn't have a chance to go over the revised spreadsheet with Phil (Platter) before he left. This may need some more tweaking, but please let me know if we're getting closer to solving the mystery of May 1st.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi

I have consolidated my notebook w/ the West Service notebook.  You will find the cash sheets in front of the west service inf0rmation.  Also, there are two new notebooks.  One says Schedule in red and the other says Schedule in blue.

Kate,
We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.  We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.  This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.  We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.

If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.

Thanks for the help.

BillNo inter-desk deals for Sunday.

For Monday - 
609239 - STCA buys 13 on peak @ $367
609240 - STCA sells 1 off peak @ $158

I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am s=

rom a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used t=

n employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the flo=
or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b=
reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would=
 wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first =
omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill. =
 Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w=
ill get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straigh=
t out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman =
is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks he=
ating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to te=
n feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, o=
r anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmo=
re's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this =
high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in t=
he middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and=
 glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV =
that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is dire=
ctly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly faci=

 of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thou=
ght, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is g=
oing to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,"=
Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, so=

, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing hi=

 only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing=
 a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the =
fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to=
 blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on th=
e old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torc=

Hi Bill,

I know you have been out and I will be out all next week so I will e-mail
these to you.

May 18th    HE 12 sale to PNM the 40 needs to be a 45 @ $120.00
May 18th    Got the note from "you all" that HE 16 PNM Cont, they show 0
and you show 13.  Need to know who is correct on this.
May 20th    Purchase totals not adding up
May 21st    Change HE 13 sale to PNM to a 20

and

May 13th   An on-peak schedule -32@Amrad ran on Sunday (13th) and shouldn't
have.  PSCO had done a month long tag that was incorrect.
                     What we agreed on was to by the -32 HE 7-22 @ $30.00
from them.  Need you to please add this to the model and ENPOWER as a
                      real-time deal.

If you have any questions, Roger will be filling in for me.

Thanks,

Kathy
Hi Bill,

I just got back in the office today and I am going over the days.  Just one
little formula problem so far...on the 20th the Ancillary Services are not
adding up on the bottom.

Thanks,

Kathy

Hi Bill,

When you get a chance can you correct this day?

HE 14 sale to CISO/Powerx 20 MWH should be @ $250.00
HE 15 sale to CISO/Powerx should be a 0 MWH (Cut at top of hour)
HE 11 and 12 sale to CISO/Powerx 25 MWH's should be @ $215.00

Also,  do you know what the 25 MWH FC/PV swap deal  with AEP/APS is.  We
don't show this in our EMS.  Could it be one of Enron's deals and on the
model
by mistake??  Prices are $350.00 and $520.00???

Thanks,

Kathy


Hi Bill,

On yesterday's...HE16 from SRP should be a -65 not -16.  Also the ancillary
is not adding up the bottom.

One more Bill,

The sale to PSCO HE 14-19  35MWH should be @ $220.00 per Tony and PSCO.

Thanks,

Kathy
Thanks for your help Bill.

One little thing on the 25th.  The ancillary are still adding up with the
regular purchases in the totals.

Thanks,

Kathy
Good morning Bill

On 4/28 could you move the -100 bookouts for HE 5 & 6 for $6.00 to the top
for direct bill.  Any cuts on the PSCO deals we are keeping together.

Also, today is the end of the month.  I will probably be checking out with
Amy (Kelley's replacement in Houston) Wed. or Thurs. so will need all the
models corrected by then.

Thanks,

Kathy
Hi Bill,

Just a couple of things on these models..

On 4/17 need HE 14 sale to Enron changed to an 11MWH.  Tony talked to Mark
about this.

On 4/18 the ancillary are not adding up at the bottom.

When you get a chance, just re-email them to me.

Thanks,

Kathy

Thanks,

KathyHey, have you heard of Less Than Jake? If not, let me know so I can bring you a cd to listen to. They are from Gainesville, FL!  It's fast, loud, fun with horns. Good stuff. So it's already 2pm. That's good news, eh? If only it were like 6pm.....

cheersHey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so orange and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the Enron gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the meatheads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for you (maybe 9ish). Good morning,

I'd love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him? This morning I am kinda under some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I really don't have much spare time right now. JA would flip out if I left for coffee now. Maybe later this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? Anyhow, another ride sounds really cool. I had lots of fun. And yes, it would be cooler if I didn't have to worry about work. Let me know when you have extra time to go for a ride.
My weekend was pretty fun. I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the first time. It looks so bad. I so don't know anything about lawn care. Also I planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy, but it s worth a try. Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard. It's pretty cool. I bought some step-in switch boots, too. Cool, eh? 
So I'll talk to you later. Have a great day.Hey let's go get coffee again that was really fun. I'm so much more awake now. When will you be back from Vegas? Sunday night right? I'm sure you told me but I have a terrible memory.Good morning. I'm glad to hear that you are having a better day today. Me, too so far. Yeah, I stayed last night until like 7:45 and finished up that stuff with Mike Etringer. So today should be a bit more chill for me which is awesome. Anyhow, I hope nothing blows up over there for you. Maybe we can go to get some coffee later or something. Did you end up going out last night for some beers? I watched Alli McBeal and ate dinner. It was pretty exciting. Howdy. 

So are you about to leave work or what? I really can't believe that it is already 4:30. Crazy. Anyhows, are you going to that Happy Hour deal on thursday night? Free drinks?! Should be a good time. I didn't make it to the last one and I was kinda bummed about it. 

I hope I can get outta here at a reasonable hour tonight. I'm gonna go pump some iron at Bally's with all the meatheads if I do. Should be pretty fun. See ya later! I completely forgot about your trip to Vegas. I bet you didn't! Ha ha. Anyhow, I'm bummed that you are going to gone thursday and we won't be able to hang out at the Happy Hour. You'll be having a blast in Vegas though, so no biggie. Anyhow, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don't leave too early. If not, there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week.

byeSo when are you heading over to get the monday java juice?Right.  Well, work is always crazy for you I suppose.  Yeah, I'm getting
ready to move.  This is my last week of work at the restaurant (thank god!)
and I have three weeks of class left.  I'll leave on the last day of class
(June 14) bright and early in the morning and drive west until I hit CO.
Still don't have a place to live, but I'm working on that.

I'll probably be coming back to Portland for a weekend or so during the
summer sometime so I'll look you up when I get there, if you want.

Good luck with work, I know you're doing a great job.

Christel

It might be too dangerous for you to drink your double at this time. But seriously, let me know when you are free to go hunt some java.Hey check these out dude. The Smashing Pumkins song is Drown and I can't find it on any other cd. Whaz up??

 			 
You are cracking me up. Basically you are the only thing keeping me awake today..Hey Bill (or do you prefer William Williams the 3rd),

What's up?  I bet you didn't think I'd e-mail you.
Don't worry, I have nothing against players.  Just
kidding...

I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around
Seattle frequently so I'll check them out again
sometime.  Maybe you'll luck out and they'll come to
Portland soon.  I'm sure you have a decent music scene
in Portland so you always have other options.  I've
found that you can find some really cool little bands
or musicians in the most random little bars and
restaurants.

I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can't complain.
I'm totally looking forward to summer.  There will be
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to
start taking all my "sick" days!

Have a good day.  Don't work too hard.   If you do,
make sure you play harder to make up for it.

Talk to you later.
Colleen (the first)

Is this the David Gray you are going to see?? I listened to these clips. The music is kind of slow and romantic or something. Is this how most of his sound is or did I just pick slower songs to listen to? Bill,

How's your day going? You seem busy and/or pre-occupied. Do you still wanna go get some coffee? If you are too busy, don't worry about it. I just need to drink some coffee whether it is here or there...

byeBill,
I am having such a terrible day. I am so flustrated. Can you believe it is only monday? Ah! Anyhow, I hope your day is going much better than mine. When I saw you earlier, you looked kinda angry or something. I hope I was just imaging that. Anyhow, I'd better get back to work. I'll talk to you later.I have an appointment today and will need to leave the office around 3pm..  I will be back in the office on Friday.
If you need anything before 3pm let me know, otherwise Debra will be here for any assistance you may need.

When you trade with Bloomberg, PLEASE NOTE BLOOMBERG AS THE BROKER IN DEAL ENTRY. Also, please include a $15 FLAT BROKER FEE per trade ($.60 per mw for 25 mw pieces; $.30 per mw for 50 mw pieces; $.20 per mw for 75 mw pieces). Confirms is reporting about 50 "missing" trades from the Real Time group in July. The process of "finding" these deals takes much longer than simply entering the broker in the deal at the time of entry. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about this procedure.

Hi Virginia:

I discussed w/ Kate regarding two pma items in STWHOURLY desk in the lastest desk analysis from Mark Confer.  Please let me know if I should direct these questions directly to Houston Settlements, or I'll stop by later to see if you have a minute on these issues.

1. Deal#664447.1
In the desk analysis it's showing a -$1575 due to HE7 zeroed out in July after deal liquidated on 6/27/01.
Question:  we should have an offsetting +$1530 due to upstream deal#664444.1 HE7 zeroed out in July after deal liquidated on 6/27/01, but this credit side didn't show up in the desk analysis.

2. Deal#662547.1
In the desk analysis it's showing -$1265 due to HE12 volume changed from 46MW to 23MW in July for flow date of 6/26/01.  
Question: we should have an offsetting +$1150 due to upstream deal#662543 HE12 volume changed in July after deal liquidated on 6/27/01, but this credit didn't show up in the desk analysis.


Kate and Bill:
Regaring Deal#630335.1 and it's associated deals, I believe this is what should have happened:
a. You should get back +$315 as annuity (buy) #630335.1 price was changed fm $315 to $0 in July for flow date of 6/2/01 
b. You should get a -$315 hit for transmission (buy) demand charge #648312.1 entered on 6/14/01 for flow date of 6/2/01
c. You should get back +$360 (=$675-$315) as annuity (sale) #630336.1 was entered with $315 price on 6/2/01 for 6/2/01 (this part should always been captured when the deal liquidated on 6/2) and the annuity price was later changed to $675 on 6/14/01
=> As you know Settlements already captured the +$315 in (a).  I believe Settlements didn't capture (b) and (c) because the deals were entered after the deals liquidated in the same month.  Risk can do a manual adjustment for you on this $45 credit (net of $360 and -$315) right away and then we'll take $315 in (a) as pma this month-end since we didn't take it on 8/31/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

I've entered two annuities to account for the interdesk swaps between the Services desk and ST-Cali and ST-West Hourly entered last week during the now infamous "Great Wheelabrator Clean-Up of '01." Risk informed me today that these interdesk deals would not value because they were entered for a date which has already liquidated; thus the need for annuities. They are as follows:

696403 - STWS buys from STWH
	7/21/01
	1 mw @ HE 1
	$10,880

696401 - STWS buys from STCA
	7/21/01
	1 mw @ HE 1
	$15,325

These purchase prices are strictly the value of the interdesk swaps which have been entered but will not calc. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
KateWith the departure of Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs, it is necessary to reestablish responsibilities to assure our continued success.  To this end:

Chris Foster will assume responsibility for the Services Desk in addition to retaining overall responsibility for the Middle Market Coverage Group.  Although he will continue to provide leadership to John, Paul and Stewart in managing the Middle Market Coverage effort, Chris will focus his day-to-day efforts on our Services business.  

John Malowney, Paul Choi and Stewart Rosman will be taking a greater leadership role within the Coverage Group.  Within this coverage group, John Malowney will assume a leadership role for Industrials throughout the WSCC, Stewart Rosman will assume responsibility for public utilities, IOUs and public/federal utilities in the Northwest and Northern California and Paul Choi will cover these same sectors in the Southwest and Southern California.  Although each of these individuals will take the lead in assuring coverage for their market segment, it will be done on a collaborative basis to take advantage of individual relationships and talents and to make sure there is back-up if someone is out of the office.  Additional personnel will be hired in the Middle Market Coverage Group within the next month.  Job postings will be made shortly.

Bill Williams will continue to manage the Real Time Group and will now report to Tim Belden.

Lisa Gang will move into the Services Group to help manage our scheduling agreement with El Paso and provide support for other services arrangements.  This will be effective September 10.  Lisa Gang, Les Rawson, and Stan Cocke will report to Chris Foster and endeavor to expand our already successful Services business.
 
While we will miss Holli and Greg personally, I have complete confidence that the new energy and fresh ideas that their departure brings will assure our market leader position will not compromised.

Bill -

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment. At any rate, this is a rough draft, but I thought I'd show it to you to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

KateJim & Darren -

It looks as though the only ISO true-up information Risk received was regarding our July variance of $86,743. This does not take into account the August variances totalling approx. $42,000 in revenue we did not receive throughout the month. Fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the Short Term West Hourly book; but as you can see by the attached e-mail, Risk has only accounted for July variances, not August, in this PMA. 

I did go over the Month End Variance report Jim gave me, and I have some questions about the totals listed in it - in particular having to do with charges 253, 405, 111, and 112. Let me know when one or both of you has a moment and I think we can clear this up.

Again, I think the only variances we still have out there for the WHOURLY book are the four that occurred in August, which are as follows:

8/11 - $990
8/16 - $37,787.25
8/18 - ($6,764.68)	
8/22 - $9.495.25

As long as we're all aware of the ISO charges and revenue still unaccounted for - and know they will be in the future - I think we can all sleep soundly. Let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Per your request I have double checked Risk's daily record on ISO revenue/expenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out.  Here is the result:

Daily ISO revenue/expenses total (8/1-8/31)	+$629,709 (you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your P&L )
July ISO true up					+$86,743 
=>					total	+$716,452
Month-end August ISO revenue/expenses 	+$716,481 (we got this total from Volume Mgmt)
Variance (i.e. true-up)				+$29

I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results.  Jim advised that they might have added some items "after fact" during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the month-end flash, and that's probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you.  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

review the Order.

 <<mitigation.pdf>>

 - mitigation.pdf Good Morning

For August 9th only:

We are long 51 mw HLH at PGE system due to a parking deal Sean did with Bill Casey.  The deal number is 723296.1.  

Please sell this in the RT market for the STNW book.  There are several options for this energy.

1. We have available PGE transmission PGE/COB on deal 146517

2. Portland will lay this off at Colstrip if we sold it in Montana

3. Buyers could pick it up at PGE system

4. We could also sell this at the Mid C if PGE approves it ahead of time

Please see Sean or Myself if you have any questions.

Group,

Just wanted to let you know that as of HE1 on August 23rd, we will no longer be the Scheduling Coordinator for Delano Energy.  AES bought them out, so they will be doing their SC services for them.

Thanks,
Stan
Please make a note of the following. I know we have several new traders, and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process. But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job. Thanks.

1. Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book. Pay attention when extending deals. If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book, you don't have energy to sell from that book.

2. Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso. Also, pay attention to detail with EPE spinning reserves (as a violation is extremely expensive for EPE), also curtail units in the right order. Copper then Newman 4 then Four Corners (Be sure to curtail Four Corners before selling under cost!)

3. El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done. Check spreadsheet formulas. Print a copy of the model and attach it to the CARP before filing.

4. El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model (m://electric/epe/epe01/aug01/epe reconciliation model) and all variances explained.

5. Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $15 FLAT broker fee per trade. If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades, enter a per-megawatt fee, and extend the deal later with bilateral trades, you're effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL. 

6. Most importantly, if you are not sure, call someone who is.

Thanks again for your attention to these matters.

KateBill, Chris,

I think this is the market notice you two were refering to.  Yes, CAISO  will use the lower of SC-submitted bids or a unit's proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the MCP of supplemental energy and A/S. However, my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and A/S.  If you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your unit's proxy costs (and are willing to justify them), you should bid your higher-than-proxy costs. If you are accepted, you are supposed to be paid as bid.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with CAISO (or let me know if you have asked them about this).


 We'll be short 25 mw at Palo Verde under the STWBOM book for Monday (also 25 short under STSW). Buy to cover this real time. Sell back to EPE @ $0. Enter buys and sales under the same desk, either STWBOM or STSW. Here are the deals:

I wanted to give everyone a status report on FSP before I head-out on vacation.  In a nutshell, it's not quite there.  We are now meeting performance targets but we had a few too many bugs to allow users to complete the parallel in-time.  I will begin paying my dollar a day debt starting on Saturday but I feel fairly confident that we should wrap things up next week.  Susan Amador will be working in Portland next week, in my absence, to ensure real-time can finish up their part.

Thanks,  David Poston

Here are the details for the remaining 6 days of the parallel:
DA preferreds & finals are complete for 5/29 - 5/31
DA preferreds are 99% complete for 6/1 - 6/3.  (*Waiting on ST-CALI to input the last few schedules)

Performance figures
Template writing = 1:30 - 2:30 (target <3 minutes)
Finals processing = 7 minutes (target <10 minutes)

Bugs
1 remaining critical bug on exercises for supplement schedules, should be finished tomorrow

Preliminary Schedule (contingent on no new critical bugs found by real-time)
1.  Wrap-up HA parallel first part of next week
2.  Migrate code to production end of next week
3.  Begin production parallel.  As suggested by Phil Platter, we will continue using the existing toolset but we will write DA preferred templates out of FSP at the same time.  Then we can execute some compare utilities we have developed to ensure the ISO templates between CAPS & FSP match perfectly.
4.  We will run in this mode until the users feel good about FSP.

Group,

This is an email I sent to our generators regarding decing and buy-back strategies.  Please read so you know what's going, and can take the lead on implementing these strategies.  We'll let you know when all the generators on board.

Thanks,
Stan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours, we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec. bidding or buying-back generation that you've sold forward.  We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy.  As the weather turns cold during the late-Autumn and Winter months, the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market.

Lately, HE1-10 have been very weak real-time, ranging between $25 and $40.  We have two strategies that we would like to suggest:

1.  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec. bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate.  Basically, we would be letting the ISO know that we're willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw's from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity.  You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it from the ISO.  For example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If the ISO takes the decremental bid, and the price is $30, then you make $20/MWh.   

Advantages - A relatively large upside, the price the ISO charges could actually go negative, as large as negative $91.87.  Also, you would actually be buying from the ISO, as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk.

Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch.  When we submit decremental bids, the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes.  In addition to the physical problems this might create, the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow.

2.  Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market:
This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate.  This would call for you to reduce your generation, and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity.  Once again, you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy.   As in the previous example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If we can buy-back the energy for a price of $30, then you make $20/MWh.   Additionally, if we do buy-back the energy, we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order.  Then, if the ISO takes the incremental bid, you can generate the power and sell for additional profit. 

Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch (unless a supplemental bid is accepted).  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced.  Also, the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage.

Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding.

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy #2, buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market.  Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy, then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO.  We propose a 50/50 profit split, above your day-ahead profit, earned from either of these two strategies.

If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster.

Group,

This evening, Wednesday, 7/25, for HE23-24, Sierra Power has 7mw available to sell.  Please sell for the best price you can get.  They have to run, so they are not price sensitive (but don't rape them).  Since they are only 7mw, if you take a $10 spread that would be fine.  They are in SP15, we are their SC, and their unit ID is VESTAL_6_WDFIRE.

Any questions please give me a call.

Thanks,
StanA few weeks ago I sent out an e-mail announcing Sean Crandall's departure from Enron.  Upon further consideration, Sean has decided to stay with us.  Please join me in welcoming him back from his European vacation.
Bill,

Enron Canada has encountered several hours in the last few weeks where we have acquired non-firm transmission (hourly) from BC Hydro, been able to flow (i.e. not been cut) and the Portland real-time desk has been unable to find a buyer. I realize that the timing of the hourly non-firm transmission is difficult. The financial cost to Enron Canada is C$6.40 per MWh for every MW we buy from BC and can't flow- in excess ot C$1,400 last night.

Are there any players in the Pacific NorthWest who Enron can use as a buyer of last resort? Do have any suggestions that may alleviate the "no buyer found" problems?

Harbor Cogen has been prescheduled for Thursday, 8/9, 80mw, HE7-22.  There are a few things that needs to be done in real-time:

1.	We would like to try to buy-back the first few hours for something under $67.50 (what they sold for day-ahead.  We'll use their day-ahead price rather than their generation costs because we sold day-ahead for slightly below their generation costs of $69.50 in order to make money with this buy-back strategy and selling 15mw from the steam turbine in real-time).  So, please try to buy-back, HE7-10 (or through HE11 if prices warrant), 80mw, SP15.  Treat this like the Delano buy-back, where we split the profit with the customer.  Please stay in contact with the control room to communicate which hour they are supposed to come up for.

2.	We need to sell 15mw from the steam turbine in real-time.  The steam turbine can only be started up 3 hours after the gas turbine is fired up.  On the back end, it can shut down the same hour that the gas turbine shuts down.  So, please sell 15mw, SP15, beginning 3 hours after the gas turbine comes on.  For example, if you bring the gas turbine on beginning HE11, please begin selling the steam turbine HE14 through HE22.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.

Thanks a bunch,
Stan Bill,

Bill, 
Just wanted to confirm our meeting in PDX tomorrow @1 p.m.  The following is just a brief checklist of Hafslund's current / potential needs / wants on mw's ranging in size from 10  to 150 mw:
*realtime dispatchability of our firm power contracts.  
*day ahead parking / lending services at major hubs (pv,mid c, cali) 
*ancillary services bidding from our cogen /  qf contracts. 
*optionality of services...i.e. some days hafslund may not need enron's services.  
Looking for Enron's price on the bundled services or individual service.  Would it be a fixed price per mw? percentage of power sales per mw? sliding scale based on mw volume and # of services provided?  etc....
Let me know if you have questions or concerns or if Thursday's meeting no longer works for you.

  VIrginiaThe lower-of-bid or proxy cost rule only applies during System Emergencies.  The rest of the time the ISO uses your bid, assuming you have submitted one.  This so-called improvement only makes things worse because during System Emergencies you cannot bid above the proxy price because the software will default to proxy prices if your bid exceeds the proxy price.

Subject:	Do Supplemental Energy Bids Matter?

Bill, Chris,

I think this is the market notice you two were refering to.  Yes, CAISO  will use the lower of SC-submitted bids or a unit's proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the MCP of supplemental energy and A/S. However, my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and A/S.  If you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your unit's proxy costs (and are willing to justify them), you should bid your higher-than-proxy costs. If you are accepted, you are supposed to be paid as bid.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with CAISO (or let me know if you have asked them about this).


 << File: Market Notice Change in Proxy Bid Calc.pdf >> 
Stan recieved a call from BPA about Frontier reserves.  When ever Frontier comes back up we need to pay back BPA.  We owe BPA 44 MW on peak and 9 MW off peak.
Send Frontier to BPA for 5 1/2 hours on peak and 1 hour off peak.  

ToddA fast way to see the MCP is under Energy Prices at http://www.caiso.com/.
You'll notice that in hours 15, 16, 17 and 18 yesterday the MCP was set by
the proxy price when we were in a Stage 1 then 2 Emergency.  Other hours
were set by the previous Stage 1 cap.

We have checked out with our counterparties according to our numbers, but MPC claims they have done their control area checkouts and they stick by their numbers.  There is a grey line here because the MW's that we are missing on those 5 days are actually 'in favor' of the counterparty who we sold to, so it may be that they had a discrepancy, but did not pipe up.
None-the-less, if I 'adjust our system accordingly' (meaning, put the trades in or increase the # of MW's), we'll have to hear from those counterparties.  I'm planning on telling them that the control area checkouts have been done and that they need to check their control area numbers.  I think Sandy at MPC will be willing to support us if our sale counterparties want proof.

Let me know if you have any other thoughts.

Thanks to Kate for all her help.

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

Bottom of Form 0Hey there Bill!

Ok an update and a little explanation.  I'm sorry I couldn't write you
yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients.  But I'm writing you now.  I
just pray that I won't get too busy today!  That probably won't work all
that well since I'm here and not at church where I should be!!!  Catholics
are funny about that stuff.  Yep,  I'm the "good little Catholic girl".  My
mom's a first grade Catholic private school teacher, my dad used to teach
CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and
confeesion on Saturdays.  It doen't always work out so well if you know what
I mean.  I took a Sunday shift today didn't I?

Anyhow... the POrtland trip.  Let me share with you the dilemma.  Ok I set
aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation.  That money is
currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral
in LA.  Also my family members (the son of the one who died) was coming up
to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive
restraunts etc.  So that probably won't happen.  But basically it's the
first reason.  I don't know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane
ticket plus any other details food, funeral flowers/gifts, etc. and still
get to go to Portland.
Plus I'm moving in a month so I'm going to have moving expenses as well!
Ughhh!  I want to go soooo bad!

But things all happen for a reason.  It looks like I may not be able to go
but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket.


Aprox. 3 hours later............

Well I just got off the phone with you, so you actually know all about the
about issues above.  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you.
You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour!  WOW!!

I don't think I can send my picture on this computer.  I'll try but it may
not work.  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think I'm an ogre (is
that spelled right??).  I tell you what... I'll send you one if you send me
one.  Deal?  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the
other person looks like that you are talking to.  Then again some people
look better in pictures than in real life.  I'm not fortunate enough to be
one of those!

Geez... we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I don't
really have anything to say.  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it
because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to
reference this!! :)

Oh well saved by the bell....a co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch!
He really is a sweet guy.  I'm not sure but I think he's a little slow.
Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do
the filing and patient transport for me.  He is such a nice guy!  then today
he knows I'm moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in
to bring me lunch.  Awwwh!  I am going to miss alot of people out here.

You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit.  Any ideas
when that might be?  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you
that oyu have extended to me.  If you are in my vicinity you are more than
welcome to stay with me and I'll show you around.  Unless of course you are
coming out soon then it would be more like ...."ok we are two lost tourist."
I would love to see alot of the LA things!  Sunset BLVD., Universal Studios,
all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area!  I hear
they are fabulous!!!  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around I'll be well
versed in "the places to be".  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the
Wishire Regency Hotel.  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet!  Complete
with chocolate covered strawberries!  Yummm.

Oh I am a fanatic about desserts!

I better not keeping Lee waiting!  He's figitty!  Talk to you soon!!

ScottyAlthough a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of "spot" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.

 - C.DTF Hi Guys,

Just a quick reminder that I do need to get a $50 from all of you who want
to play on the Green Room's Fall '01 Soccer Team.     The money ($670 2nd
Division or $760 for 1st Division) is due to the league by July 23rd so I
need  you to send me a check ASAP.  My address is 8573 SW Dakota Drive
Tualatin, OR 97062. The 10 games will be on Sundays from 12 -2 mostly some
2-4 games starting on September 9th.

The other issue I need you to ponder is 1st Division vs 2nd Division.  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in 2nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship (for 2 years) if we are 1st or 2nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to 1st division.  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager (nay volunteers?) and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out 1st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better.   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in 2nd or move up to 1st.  Also send me
money!  Thanks.

Thanks for completing that request so quickly. Unfortunately, I received a message from Todd Bland over the weekend saying he is still unable to save deals using his own name. He called Enpower support and spoke with Nicolay, who told Todd he needed an Originator ID - are you familiar with that or how Todd could get one? Also, we have one more trader who never received access to trade under these desks: Short Term West BOM, Short Term Southwest, Short Term California. His name is Steve Merriss. Could you please add his name to the list as well?

Thanks again for all of your help.

JimBill -

I talked to Heather about the term of this annuity - HE 1 on 6/21 - and she seemed to think it would pull into tonight's calc so we'd see the revenue on tomorrow's DPR. If we don't, however, Heather has said she would be happy to forward-date the deal so we can avoid the iniquitous payment-by-PMA.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Your current agreements has now expired (dated 6/21 and not signed until 7/9 - only good for 14 days).  In addition, you did not sign all the necessary places - each document requires 2 signatures (pg 6 and pg 7) - you only signed page 7 on both.

Duke's Calif Whistleblowers Have History Of Grievances  Updated: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 07:36 PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Three former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy (DUK </investments/quotes/?symbol=DUK>, news </investments/news/?symbol=DUK>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=DUK>) ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant, including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination, the men told Dow Jones Newswires. 
Most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant's previous owner, Sempra Energy (SRE </investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant. But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Duke's profit-centered management style in the deregulated market. 
Duke has called the employees' allegations about its operating procedures "baseless." Duke has said the employees have an "ax to grind," because they weren't hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDG&E's workforce. 
The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers, who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging. The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives. 
Glenn Johnson, 52, a mechanic at the South Bay power plant, alone filed 30 complaints. On one occasion, Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos. He also has a harassment complaint against SDG&E regarding an employee who now works for Duke, but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it. 
Aside from the formal complaints, Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment. 
"This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business," he said. 
One of the other employees, Jim Olkjer, 56, a former assistant control room operator at the power plant, filed three complaints against SDG&E while Duke operated the plant, because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision. The grievances were either turned down or settled, he said. 
Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldn't be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April. 
"I'm on a fixed income now," Olkjer said in an interview. "I can't afford my utility bills on a fixed income." 
The third employee, Ed Edwards, 42, a certified power plant mechanic, said he filed one complaint against three SDG&E employees in 1999 for racial discrimination. One of the employees was hired by Duke. That case is still pending. 
Edwards, an African-American, said Duke didn't hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees. Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDG&E were replaced with white employees when Duke took over. 
Edwards, who stopped working at the plant in February, said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson. 
"I knew I wouldn't be hired," he said. 
Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDG&E with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
SDG&E spokesman Art Larson wouldn't comment on the allegations. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and "always hires the most qualified employees." 
In 1999, Duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the U.S. Department of Labor for $769,700, in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions. 
Dissatisfaction With New Priorities 
The former employees said they weren't motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state. Johnson first alerted the media about Duke's behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers. 
The employees each earned about $1,000 a week. 
All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down, tossing out spare parts, and operating machinery when it was broken. Olkjer said he saw the plant's output reduced during the worst power emergencies "at least 50 times." 
When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him, "It's none of your business." 
The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff, and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant. 
"I was paid to twist wrenches," Johnson said. "The last raise I got two years ago was 2.25%. That's an insult to my skill." 
Duke said it is bringing the former SDG&E employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245. The workers were previously represented by another local, and Duke wanted a single contract. 
Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the company's "gluttony and greed." He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant. 
Johnson, Edwards and Olkjer said "in the old days" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down. But as soon as deregulation became law in the state, things started to change. SDG&E would also vary the plant's output, but not as dramatically as Duke did, they said. 
"To the best of my recollection, we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time," Edwards said. "Once Duke took the reins, that changed. We were no longer a family." 
Duke has said that it adjusted the plant's output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. 
The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid, and the employees who testified weren't in a position to know the whole picture, said Bill Hall, vice president of Duke's western operations. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan. 16-18, the period cited from the control-room logs, to keep supply in balance. A copy of the ISO control-room logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders during a Stage 3 emergency, because it didn't need Duke's capacity, which it thought too expensive.

just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week."

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

I've already done the usual.  As I told you before, we don't have the tapes here.  You make the decision if you want to order them for the $40 spread.  Still working on the other deals you asked about.  The answers are out of my realm, so I have an appointment with Risk to find out what's happening and why we're seeing things 'calc'd' at the apparent correct price when they are in EnPower at an incorrect price.

Dear Settlements Coordinators,

  I'd like to ask a favor...
  Could you guys please check your counterparties to see if anyone has a dispute on 3-14-01 regarding a purchase or sale of 40 MW at HE 3? 
    

   Sincere thanks,

  VirginiaWe're going short again - 50 mw - in a lending agreement with El Paso for Thursday. As we've done the past three days, please reduce the purchase from El Paso (702181) to $4 after purchasing elsewhere in the market (adjust price accordingly if you buy from El Paso). Then sell back to El Paso at a zero price. Details are as follows.....

702181 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

702184 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

702194 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 mw @ $69

If this makes no sense, ask Bill or me or a colleague of superior intelligence for clarification.

Thanks,

	Tonight we are having the large 'TV' removed from the SE Corner of the floor and the one in the SW corner moved out of the walkway space.  

The removal of the large screen is due to how low it hangs and the hazard it presents to people walking in the area.  Since we do not use that screen, and we do not have a good place to put it, we will store it until a suitable use is identified. 

The smaller screen will be move North and East about 3 feet to get it out of the walkway.

DaveGroup,

Delano suffered a unit outage at approximately 1200 PDT on Thursday, 7/12.  Pandol Unit 1 went down due to a boiler tube leak.  They expect the unit to return around 1200 PDT on Friday, 7/13.  They were prescheduled at 45mw on-peak Thursday, 30mw off-peak Thursday, and 30mw all day on Friday.  Because of the unit outage they are only able to produce a total of 25mw.  Bert has already purchased 20mw through HE22 to cover their peak schedule.  Please purchase 5mw for HE23 on Thursday through HE12 on Friday to cover their Friday schedule.  Before you do this call the control room to see if they are still expecting to be down through HE12 on Friday.  They sold day-ahead at $56.  Please try to purchase for less than $56, while still taking $5 for yourselves (for example, if you can purchase for $45, then sell it to Delano at $50).

Also, we told the ISO that they would only be down through HE24 on Thursday, so they wouldn't cut our day-ahead schedule.  You need to call the ISO real-time generation desk (916-351-2488) this evening around 10pm to tell them that you had to purchase replacement power for Delano through HE12 on Friday.  Once again you might want to call the control room just before you call the ISO to confirm that they will be returning around HE12 on Friday.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

Importance:	High

Group,

I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.

Therefore: 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.

If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such.

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

Thanks,
Bill
Because Lotus will probably go away when the new Enpower system comes online,  and Mike brought up a good point about not being able to mine information from the current emails that we do,  we need to think of a way to have a data repository like the West Power discussion.

I am thinking a web-based format kind of like a news group, but would like to talk to you.

C
At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. "Professional Services" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.Guys-

  Fran and I have just noticed that two of the deals remarketed real-time were put on the ST NW book and the third was put on the W Hourly book.

  We need to get together and chat so that we can keep this consistent and make sure that the right books recognize the changes.

  Let me know if you will have time this afternoon by 3.
 If not, let's plan to meet tomorrow.

  Thanks,

  VirginiaBill -

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment. At any rate, this is a rough draft, but I thought I'd show it to you to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

KateThe ISO is experiencing increasing loading on the Pittsburg-Tassaraja 230kV
line and requires additional decremental energy bids on the north side of
the path and incremental energy bids on the south side of the path.  To the
extent that Scheduling Coordinators do not respond with sufficient energy
bids to mitigate the anticipated congestion, the ISO may invoke the other
steps of the Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Procedure.  Sent by Market
Operations.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice. Here are a couple of the highlights of today's ISO call:		

1.  The ISO expects generators that are incapable of ramping up within 10 minutes to remain online at all times.
2.  Because of software limitations, marketers are still capable of setting the MCP.  The ISO hopes to fix this within a few weeks, at the earliest.
3.  The ISO plans to publish the emission costs this week that will be charged to SCs for demand within California.
4.  SCs scheduling wheel-through transactions or exports out of California will not be subject to emission or start-up fuel costs.
5.  The ISO is dispatching generators during both emergency and non-emergency hours.
6.  For purposes of determining when a new Stage 1 has occurred, the ISO requires a minimum of 70 minutes:  10 minutes before the operating hour plus the operating hour.
7.  Under this requirement, the ISO could be in Stage 1 for up to 128 minutes without triggering a new Stage 1 that is capable of resetting the proxy price.

If you have any questions, let me know.

SteveAll:

Several of our automated data acquisition and analysis systems have been interrupted since last Friday afternoon due to the "Code Red" worm that's been attacking federal web servers. Apparently aimed initially at White House servers, the worm quickly found its way to other federal servers and has now shut down all web service in the army.mil domain, including the Corp of Engineers, which furnishes much of our hydro data. Other internet sources have also been interrupted.

We're working on alternative data sources and transfer methods, but web site content will likely be spotty for the balance of the week. Also, we're retaining the Mt Hood conference room for this afternoon, but we won't have a structured presentation.

Samuel -

Thanks for completing that request so quickly. Unfortunately, I received a message from Todd Bland over the weekend saying he is still unable to save deals using his own name. He called Enpower support and spoke with Nicolay, who told Todd he needed an Originator ID - are you familiar with that or how Todd could get one? Also, we have one more trader who never received access to trade under these desks: Short Term West BOM, Short Term Southwest, Short Term California. His name is Steve Merriss. Could you please add his name to the list as well?

Thanks again for all of your help.

We're once again in need of a new trader ID - Todd Bland joined the Portland Real Time group as a summer intern, and it seems he hasn't been added yet. Could we get his name added as a trader for the following desks:

Short Term West Hourly
Short Term West BOM

One of the benefits of our suite at PGE Park is that we have the first right of refusal on non-Portland Family Entertainment events such as PSU Football games and the City JazzFest concert.  ENA will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public.  Non-Portland Family Entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for Enron employees, and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties.  

If you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the PSU Football games or City JazzFest, please notify me via e-mail by 2 pm Pacific Time, Friday, June 8.  These tickets are to be purchased by the employee. The entire suite must be purchased by Enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets.  Twenty-two tickets per event are available:  18 are seats and stools, 4 are standing room.

?	The price for City JazzFest (Sunday, July 15) is $916 for 22 tickets = about $42 per ticket.  

?	The price for all 6 PSU Vikings games (22 tickets each) is $1,404:  about $11 per game, per person, and all 6 games must be purchased.

We will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Anna

Description of City JazzFest:  This full day music fest will feature Jeff Lorber, Spyro Gyra, Marc Antoine and the headlining package, Dave Koz & Friends including Michael McDonald, Brian Culbertson and Norman Brown. The show is produced by House Of Blues Concerts.  An intimate concert setting has been developed at PGE Park that will feel like a small amphitheatre, but with all the new amenities PGE Park has to offer.Thanks for the note Bill, I appreaciate it.  I have been checking your sheets every morning and believe that I have captured all of the cong revenue since 7/10.  A quick FYI, I start in Fundies next week and thus the responsibility transfers back to Jim for the daily Flash.

Kourtney,
Just a quick heads up for the flash.
Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Fran-


 Though this is a mess, I will attempt to explain the changes I have made (given the information that I received from Bill Williams III this morning):

   I took deal # 421598.1 from 4 to a 7 MW by adding an extra 3 MW's at a $0 price.  LP owes us $0 for the energy that was ramped down because we buy it back from them.  I added deal # 754187.1 to purchase back the 3 MW at a $0 price. I put in a $0 price because we paid LP for these 3 MW's thru annuity # 531549.1 that pays LP 70% of what we sold the 3 MW for on real time (deals # 530654.1, 530716.1 and 530689.1) Please remember these changes span 2 days: 2-23-01 and 2-24-01.   

  I changed deal # 530689.1 from W Hourly book to ST NW because ST NW recognizes both purchase from PGE (529161.1) and sale to Puget (530689.1).  There is an intra-desk annuity # 531524.1 with which ST NW is compensating ST W Hourly for remarketing the power and an intra-desk deal # 531546.1 with which ST W Hourly is compensating LT NW for the basis price of $48.

  Below is a snapshot of what the deals now look like in scheduling. 
  I hope this helps to explain everything.
  Please let me know if you have any questions.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

From the WSJ....

Enron 's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge
As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post 
By John R. Emshwiller 
  
08/16/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A2 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Jeffrey K. Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giant's chief executive officer after only about six months in the job.

In an interview yesterday, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houston-based Enron . On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he had resigned for "personal reasons" unrelated to Enron 's business activities.

In the interview, he reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign from the company's board or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's duties at the nation's biggest energy trader.

However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his "personal reasons" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company's stock performance a "kind of ultimate score card," Mr. Skilling noted that Enron 's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.

Mr. Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally. "I put a lot of pressure on myself" for that decline, he said. "I felt I must not be communicating well enough" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enron 's strong financial results over the past several quarters, based largely on growing volumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, including electricity, pulp and paper.

If the stock price had remained up "I don't think I would have felt the pressure to leave," he said.

In January, Enron topped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It closed Tuesday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a share. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, after falling below $37 during the day.

Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees, many of whom are shareholders. "People would say `What is going on with the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustrating," said Mr. Skilling.

The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious, bright and thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal had been becoming Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the "final straw" in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That trip helped reinforce "how tenuous life is," said Mr. Skilling, who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.

While Mr. Skilling said Enron is in "great shape," his departure raised anxiety in the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance, lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on "uncertainty" created by the resignation.

Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name two executives to the existing "office of the chairman" within the next few days or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom the two would be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling. After the Day ahead market ran, the PDCI (TNOB) branch group TTC in the
(N-S) direction was changed from 2572 MW to 2544 MW for HE's 0100 through
1200 for operating day 8/1/01.  The reason for the change is for work on the
Valve Group 6 at Sylmar.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with
these values is HE 0600.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.  
Group,

Just wanted to let you know that beginning Thursday, 7/26, we have a new services customer on board.  They are called Nove Investments, they are a 2mw landfill generator in NP15.  They will be prescheduled day-ahead for the most part, so there won't be much real-time action required (unless they suffer a unit outage).  All their information (such as unit ID, preschedule, and contact person) will be on their services sheet in the Services Book.

Thanks,
Stan


Are you creative? Do you have a great imagination? Can you create something out of nothing? Are you fast on your feet?
If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then I have a challenge for you!
We are looking to create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  Oh, did I mention that your materials will consist only of Legos?  That's right - LEGOS. 
Here is the layout -
			Friday, August 10th
			11:00 a.m. 	Teams assemble to begin construction.
			11:45 a.m. 	Construction is complete.
			12:00 p.m. 	Ken Lay will host - The Applause Meter. The winning team will then be recognized by Mr. Lay and he will 					follow up with an e-mail to all Houston employees.
Here are the guidelines -																
			1.  Teams must consist of 7-10 members from your Business Unit.  I need to have at least 3 executives (Directors, Vice 				     	     Presidents, or Managing Directors) to this team.   
			2.  The model must be free-standing. 
			3.  Your choice of other materials may be used!
Be sure to encourage your co-workers to come and cheer you on!  Please give me a call or e-mail me if you are interested in participating.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit child care centers.
Thank you,
Julie Clyatt

Can you make sure that everyone in Real Time knows that if the ISO calls to remove a Waiver for a generator, the Services Desk needs to be notified.  Last evening, apparently the ISO called and removed a waiver for Harbor with Craig and we were not notified.  It is not his fault as we have not communicated the importance of this, but from now on, we need to be notified.  This is because we will need to put in supplementals or at least be aware that we could be dispatched at any time once the waiver is pulled.  It also gives us a heads up that the ISO needs energy.

Thanks!

(Cell) 503/702-8568Question of propriety might end access to control room
 
By Toby Eckert 
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
August 21, 2001 

WASHINGTON -- Electricity buyers for the state are expected to lose access to a power-grid control room next month, now that a California congressman has raised questions about the propriety of the arrangement. 
But a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity for the state during the ongoing power crisis, denied the move was a response to Rep. Doug Ose's objections. 
With the crisis no longer so acute, there is less need for water resources personnel to have access to the Independent System Operator's control room in Folsom, said Oscar Hidalgo, a water resources spokesman. 
"We're basically trying to cycle out of there," he said. 
Ose, R-Sacramento, spotlighted the water resources department's access to the control room during a House subcommittee hearing Aug. 2. In a prepared statement, he charged that the arrangement allowed the water resources department "to cherry-pick its power purchases." 
Ose said the arrangement violated federal regulations and "possibly cost Californians billions of dollars in potential refunds." 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said Department of Water Resources contracts should not be subject to refunds the state is seeking for over-priced power, contending the agency had a competitive advantage. 
Among those who once had access to the room were four energy consultants to the state who were fired for owning stock in a power company from which they were purchasing electricity. 
Appointees of Gov. Gray Davis oversee both the ISO and the water resources department. 
Hidalgo said water resources personnel needed access to the control room to coordinate power purchases during a crisis situation. 
"In order to keep the lights on in California, this was something that was necessary, we felt," he said. "We did our best to minimize our exposure to any material that was not intended for our usage." 
His comments echoed ISO President Terry Winter's defense of the practice before the House subcommittee. 
With numerous long-term power contracts in place and the threat of blackouts receding, water resources has set a goal of removing all personnel from the control room by Sept. 1, Hidalgo said. 
Six water resources personnel still have access to the room, he said. 
Last week, Winter sent a memo to Ose listing nine people who had access to the room and 14 others who no longer had access.

<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>To All,

Attached to this message is a complete report on issues that are of concern to Enron.  

Below is a highlight version of the key issues contained in the report.  

FERC Seam Technical Conference report by Frank Afranji - Key message - Western RTOs, act now, act responsibly, if you don't FERC will do it for us and impose the PJM model
OASIS Phase II as reported by Jerry Dempsey - Key message - Western entities need to be more pro-active in attending and providing input to the NERC Electronic Scheduling Collaborative otheriwse they run the risk of NERC imposing standards which are not applicable to western RTO development.
Resource Adequacy - aka - Installed Capacity Markets.  NERC is considering California as an example of how the "Market" has failed to provide adequate generating resources to meet the needs of the region.  There are discussions now taking place to consider development of "Resource Adequacy" standards.
RTO Congestion Management Updates - When citing how DSTAR will align closly with RTO West's physical flow-path congestion management paradigm, Jerry Smith of APS publically corrected Mike Raezer and stated that on "Day-One" the DSTAR PTOs are implementing contract path.
West of Hatway - Rating decrease from 2800 to 2200, reasons and remidies along with possible new RAS requirements.
Path Connectivity Map - Does this idea make sense?  What would you like to see added? (Traders input requested)


If you have any questions, concerns or wish to be removed from the distribution list, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. 


Enron Engineering and Operational Services
Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK.  

John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly.

Enron Industrial Markets
The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers.

Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps.      


IN THE NEWS
HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. 
Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman.
"Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman," Lay said. "In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe."

Subject:	El Paso Model 8/28

FYI -

The CARP for 8/28 was not flat, which wouldn't bother me so much if A) Bert hadn't told me it was the one thing that was actually flat for the day, and B) Craig hadn't written "Variance explained" on the print-out. Explained variances do not consist of deals entered at the wrong price - i.e. the lending purchase from El Paso that we've been entering day-ahead and reducing the price real time for the past month. Because we left this price at $58 and didn't reduce it to the $2 service fee, the STWBOM and STSW books each lost approx. $22,000 in today's DPR.

I know yesterday was messy and you weren't left with a lot to go on; but this is one pretty standard practice that shouldn't be overlooked. Now don't get defensive - I'm just reminding you.

Thanks,
Kate
Hey there ogre!!  :) Just teasing!!!


Well unfortunately I'm still up in the air over the Portland thing.  It
doesn't make it any easier when I know that not only does one of my best
friends reside there but now I have a new lil' buddy!  I am so excited about
seeing Portland and meeting you.  You are just as Brendan described!  I just
can't imagine that that big deep voice comes out of such a baby face!

Bill you know just how to push all the right buttons to get me to really
want to go!  The second paragraph of your last E-mail made me so jealous!
That was probably the most romantic setting and scene and to think that it
was written by a man!!!  I am sooo impressed!  You might not even know what
I'm talking about!  Typical male!  hahaha.  Just in case... "the roof
scene".  What's even better is that you weren't trying to be suave!

I think that your little "city portrayal" has just entered into the
..."things about Oregon I know I'm going to love".  Now we'll see if Sarah
has an open roof top!  You did miss a couple of important features though.
If I may... Uh hmmm... The scene lacks a certain social depth.  It requires
a beautiful girl/guy, a light blanket, soft music and if I drank wine (which
I don't) a bottle of Boones Farm Strawberry Hill 1993.  Ok the last part is
a joke I just don't know any other brands of wine. :)  A nice bottled water
with lemon for me I suppose.  Reverse Osmosis and filtration only.  :)

I'm sending a couple of pic's of me from my Tahoe snowboarding trip last
December.  They are actually the only ones I have in jpg format.  I think
the only differences are that I have a little curlier hair now and it's a
bit longer.  But basically I'm the same.

Tell ya what... if I do get to go I will get a hotel room not because I
don't trust you etc. but because it's just the "right" thing to do.  Then
I'll give you a call or stalk your condo building looking for the resident
on the 8th floor?? Answering to Bill Williams III and that hangs out on
rooftops.  Oh and the clencher??? It's located across the street from the
Paramount Hotel.  Scary how I listen and pay attention to detail isn't it?
You know I'm joking.... Right?  If I were like that I'd jump at the chance
to stay with you.

I really hope that I get to make it tomorrow.  If not I know I'll get to see
you last of August.  I'm counting on it!  Oh and you will stay with me at
the town house.  I insist.  It's a little different when a girl stays with a
guy then when a guy stays with a girl.  It just "looks" better the other way
around!  But like I said you WILL stay with me in August.  I'm 10 minutes to
the beach and maybe by then I'll have my California tan!  Mmmm!  Can't beat
that!

Ok well I'm going to bed.  I'll call you to let you know what the plans are.
My plane leaves at 9:19 am so I may not get the chance to E-mail you before
hand but we'll see.

Good night!

Nik

For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked "Confirmation" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking "No" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED.

 Les,
Last night 6/6 Dave Mitchel called at 17:45 to say he would be generating 3mw at 18:30.  I told him I'd start selling the 3's for HE:20 and if there were any problems or any changes to give me a call.   After I had already sold the 3's and bought transmission hour by hour for a couple of hours, Dave called me at 21:45 to say they would be coming on in 5 minutes.  So we sold 20,21,&22 for frontier when they were not generating.

Subject:	RE: ISO Compliance Filing on June 19 FERC Order

Donna,

This brings us back to the age-old question.  During an emergency, how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is?  Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase.  The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's (LDWP, SMUD, etc.) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion.  And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty, and another counterparty for a "do-over" (could be assessed)?  

We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages.

Thank you for the information and the follow-up.

Bill

All,

I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: 

(1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and 

(2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. 

If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733.  

Thanks,
Donna

	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or

Hey,

Do you know what group Tim Coffing is working for? 
On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write "Houston Flood Relief."  

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .

There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.

Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.fyi.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor for Greg WhalleyHeather,

  According to our conversation on how to account for the 7 MW's missing on 6-4-01 from deal # 615780.1, I have done the following:

  I found deal # 664324.1 that was entered by Bill Williams to account for these extra 7 MW's.  However, this deal was entered as a purchase annuity from LT_NW to MPC.  I didn't find any other deals for Real Time to pay back LT_NW.

  SO I extended LT_NW deal # 615780.1 in EnPower Scheduling so that MPC could be kept whole, then I took Bill's annuity deal # 664324.1, changed it to a purchase annuity from the ST_WHOURLY book to the LT_NW and changed the price from $7150.92 to $7014.92 to compensate ST_NW for the energy not sold by Real Time. 

  I hope this info will help you in calculating the DPR of these 2 deals, especially with a counterparty change.

  Please see me with any questions.

  VirginiaHere is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP") for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything wrong."  

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,?.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.

ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Thanks !!An interesting anecdote about your good friend Gray....

	"This man, in his official capacity, has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of 	ethics or conflict of interests," South asserted. "He's a pure political phony."

THE STATE
Renewed Ethics Attacks Put Davis on the Defensive
* Politics: The governor's conflict-of-interest problems with his energy advisors give GOP rival Bill Jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign 

by MARK Z. BARABAK, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER


In 1998, when Gray Davis first ran for governor, his Republican rival tested a series of attacks on Davis' ethical conduct.

There were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign, accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding Davis' voracious fund-raising activities.

But when voters heard the allegations, they simply shrugged them off. The response was, "He's a politician. Of course he does stuff like that," recalled one GOP strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for Republican nominee Dan Lungren. The campaign shelved its line of attack and Democrat Davis romped to a landslide victory.

Now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses, this time surrounding the state's electricity crisis. The issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the state's power crunch appears to have finally eased.

The charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of Bill Jones, the Republican secretary of state and Davis' sole declared rival in the race for governor. Last week, Jones called the conflict-of-interest allegations "one of the most significant, pervasive and costly" ethics scandals in California history.

But as yet, there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of Davis' energy advisors, let alone the governor himself. And unless there is some proof, many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governor's reelection prospects in November 2002.

"I don't see this becoming a dominant campaign issue," said Jim Knox, executive director of California Common Cause, the good government group and one of Davis' most prominent critics. "It's likely that the more resonant issue . . . is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved."

That said, Knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in Lungren's focus group interviews.

"The danger is that this could undermine the public's confidence in state government's ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest," Knox said. "It does surprise me that the governor's office, with all of its experience and talent, could so cavalierly disregard the state's conflict-of-interest laws, which, to me, appears to be what happened."

The controversy involves nearly a dozen Davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in California. Their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statements--revelations that resulted, in part, from Jones' pressure. Five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations.

Garry South, the governor's chief political strategist, points to the firings as evidence of Davis' probity. "Clearly, if the governor's office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there, they would not have been fired," South said.

As for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry, "there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governor's staff--or anyone in state government--owning stock in any company whatsoever," South said.

Even so, Davis' top spokesman, Steve Maviglio, earlier this month sold his 300 shares of stock in a California power company after news of his holdings surfaced. Maviglio said he lost $1,300 in the transaction.

At the least, the revelations have been a distraction for Davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackout-free summer.

"It is a mistake that didn't need to be made and shouldn't have been made," said Gale Kaufman, a Sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare Democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor. "The fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didn't need."

Republicans, of course, see a larger problem.

"He's either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration," said Rob Stutzman, a spokesman for the California Republican Party. "And we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him."

In characteristically pugnacious fashion, the Davis campaign has sought to turn Jones' charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain.

"This man, in his official capacity, has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests," South asserted. "He's a pure political phony."

But Jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the state's chief elections officer. "For the governor's office to say that I don't have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldn't be able to speak to it is patently false," Jones said.

New Life for Jones' Campaign

Whatever his stake, there is no question that the attention has given life to Jones' campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid.

The $960,000 in contributions that Jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by California standards, and the Bush White House has all but formally endorsed rival Richard Riordan, who is still exploring the race.

(Fellow Republican William E. Simon Jr., a Los Angeles investment banker, has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy.)

But ironically, for all Jones' efforts, it may be Riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy. Unlike Simon, a political neophyte, and Jones, an 18-year officeholder, Riordan had a decades-long business career before serving two terms as Los Angeles mayor.

"He's cut from a different cloth," said Don Sipple, a GOP strategist who is neutral in the governor's race. "If this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game, Riordan can point to the fact he didn't start public service until he was more than 60 years old."

But even while insisting that Davis did nothing wrong, strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governor's professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment. And Davis' best defense, they argue, is his famously modest lifestyle--a frugality symbolized during his 1998 campaign by his cramped West Hollywood home.

If anyone thinks Davis has used his office to get rich, one advisor said, "All [wife] Sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo."




Amy -

That's the best news I've heard all day! Looks like we're getting this checkout process down to a science. As far as the new scheduling fee, I'm being told that we're still negotiating a way to enter this into Enpower. I'll let you know once I've talked with Cara and Greg to determine whether or not it will be a price adjustment per MW on each deal or a lump sum annuity each month. In the meantime, just let me know when you have more information on the buy-resale prices - I think I have an answer for you.

Thanks,

Kate - Kathy has asked me about this annuity: 

 "you will be billing us an annuity for $43,708.25 for the month of
July for a scheduling fee of 25 cents per MWH associated with our
preschedules that Portland puts together for us.  This will continue from
now on.   Could you lump this monthly amount in with our total mwh purchase
amount on the invoice?"

Where will I see this?  I need it to be entered into EnPower in order to bill them  - also, will this be captured in the model?

Let me know - that is the only question I have for July - Except: the BR in the model is different fromt he BR prices in EnPower.  I am trying to figuire where they are off.  Once I do, that will be the only change (besides this annuity) that I will need you to make -THE RECONCILIATION THIS MONTH WAS GREAT!!!!!!  Thanks so much for your attention! - Amy

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out.  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this.

STNW has scheduled an extra 15 mw round-the-clock purchase from PGE at Montana System Border. We will not be flat in Real Time position manager because of this deal. You'll need to do 2 things to remedy this situation....

1. Sell off the length at Colstrip. If nobody's buying at Colstrip, you can buy a wheel from Colstrip to Hot Springs from Montana Power for $4.66/mw. FYI - the Dow Jones Mid-C price was $43 on peak, $36 off peak on 8/20 (latest numbers). 

2. Withdraw Tag #30458, which was entered to accomodate this extra schedule.

In other news, we are not doing El Paso or PGE lending for tomorrow, nor do we have a short position in California, so things should go smoothly in that respect. But then there's EOL......

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello there mister Bill!

Just a quick note to say sorry for getting off of the phone so quickly
yesterday!  To get into my apartment you have to go through a security gate
that needs to be opened by a resident.  I didn't have my pass code and I had
a visitor.  So I was scrammbling around like a lunatic trying to find it.
Most everyone who comes to visit knows the pass code so when someone new
comes to visit I have to try to remember what it is!  Then enter it into the
phone to let them in!  I think I've used it like twice in the year I've
lived here!  Anyhow so that's that!

To be quite honest with you I was so frazzled that I have no idea what you
said you needed to do or if you said I could call back after a certain time.
My mind was just focused on that code!  I thought I remembered that you
couldn't talk to me the rest of the day.  That's why I didn't call.  Ok
there's all the excuses and apologies.

Hope you're having a great day!

Nikki

--Erin & EmilyAfter careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers, I decided to leave Copper on for Friday night 8/18.  There were several reasons for this decision including the PV outage,  the fact that, Newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts, and the fact that when we needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing it up.  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the right thing to due given those factors.  If either of you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact me.  Thanks --GUZTo All,

As per todays (6/6/01) conversation with Keoni Almeida (Enron's customer rep at the CAISO) the CAISO has been directed by their board to post only the Market Clearing prices.  What this means is the following:

During "Normal" operating periods the Market Clearing Price may be the true cost of energy in the ISO.  The component that could be missing is the cost and volume of the Out Of Market calls, if any - but there's no way to know, since this information is not posted.

During any Stage 1-3 market mitigation procedures, the Market Clearing Price is the highest Proxy Price of the least efficient unit selected under the mitigation procedures. The ISO is setting the emission credit value to zero and the proxy has never included gas transportation costs, the proxy MCP is not really a measure of marginal cost.  Further the proxy MCP excludes the cost and volumes of the Out Of Market calls and any accepted "pay-as-bid" costs and volumes.

To find the MCP (Proxy Price during Stage 1-3) the following link http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/pubmkt2.html button number 17.

The impacts of the lack of this information include, but are not limited to, our knowing what the real-time cost of going short as a scheduling coordinator would be or the actual cost of congestion.  Not having access to the complete pricing picture hampers the ability of the real-time traders in the west from making the best business decisions possible.

Since it has been articulated by Kenoi that the CAISO Board has made a conscious decision not to post a complete picture of the costs of energy from hour to hour it would seem that it would be appropriate for Enron to consider making an attempt to persuade the ISO to reconsider it's decision and that it would be of significant benefit to the market and the ISO to publish all pertinent pricing data.

Do you agree?  If yes, how do we proceed?  If no, why not?

Thanks,

Group,

Just wanted to let you know we have a new generator coming on line, Desert Power.  They have 2 units totaling 65mw, located in Utah, and they are in Pacificorp's service territory.  Please remember they are in Mountain Time, so please be careful when speaking with them (try to always speak in "hour ending _ Mountain Time).  

They are running this afternoon, Wednesday, 8/15, for the first time.  For the first week or so they will be "working the kinks out" in the real-time market.  The easiest thing to do would be to either sell them directly to Pacificorp, or to buy a wheel from PACE to Four Corners345 (or another point of delivery via Pacificorp's oasis web-site).  The contract language is set up to where we get 1$/MWh for dispatching the unit, plus an incentive to sell them above a certain percentage of the Dow Jones PV day-ahead index.  So, during the testing phase, please just take 1$/MWh when you're selling the unit output.

If you have any questions, Mike Etringer was the guy who put this deal together, Les is also familiar with the deal, as am I (to a smaller extent).

Thanks for your help,
StanHere are the deal numbers for Tuesday's lending agreement with El Paso....

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $68

Lisa or Susie - would you please show this in the El Paso preschedule sheet and make a tag for the schedule? Thanks for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.

One last time before we shoot it over to Mark and ISAS.  Thanks for the
comments, good catches.
 <<tag time table draft_rev3.doc>>

As far as comment #1 (LCA vs. PPT vs. PST), this gets into the white paper
idea discussed last Wednesday.  Lisa was going to tackle this (she's
given-up sleeping to fit it in) and I'd asked her to distinguish between
referencing time in a product definition versus time in a process
description.  But I believe she is on vacation fighting forest fires.

This table is used in a process (submission and assessment of E-Tags) and is
some-what independent of the time zone(s) that the product or commodity is
referenced by.  Guess I'm letting my preference slip in here - since we are
dealing with a daily process, the timing table should use a prevailing time
reference (e.g., LCA or PPT, etc.) and not a "fixed" time zone (e.g., PST,
CST, etc.).

Enough of me, let's talk about your comments to the latest table.  If there
are none, it'll go to Mark at COB Tuesday July 3rd.

Whoever is working Monday evening, 8/20, could you please call the ISO real-time desk at midnight to tell them that Harbor is coming off-line per the beginning of their temporary waiver outage.  I called the ISO today to request a temporary waiver for Harbor.  It was granted for two days, beginning HE1 on Tuesday, 8/21.  Which means they are temporarily waived from the "must offer" prevision of the FERC order for that time period.  The ISO requested that someone from real-time call to confirm that Harbor was going off-line (although they are already off-line, just tell them that they are going to begin their scheduled temporary waiver outage).

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out.  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Chip and Dave -

I've just spent an hour on the phone with IT in Houston regarding the e-mail I sent out this morning (re: John Anderson's application access). Both Leola and Shari at the IT Central desk (wherever e-mails go when you send them from the e-request website) confirmed that they were able to login as John Casey Anderson and, more importantly, were able to login to Enpower. Interestingly enough, Casey has yet to avail himself of the wonders of the Enpower application here in Portland. I have also tried logging on as janders3, and I do in fact see a link to Enpower in the Start menu under Business Applications; however, it tells me this link has been moved or removed.  

Shari told me there was nothing more she could do for me if I'm not seeing the same links that she is; so at this point I'm going to call on your expertise one more time, and hope that we can solve this together.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,
KateMike McDonald and I met with WAPA and the Bureau of Reclamation on Tuesday (7/17) and learned some interesting information about their relationship with PG&E.  On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA.  Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party.  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month.  As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.

As of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices).  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.  We probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list.

Officials study grid's close call 
Published Friday, Aug. 10, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY STEVE JOHNSON, JOHN WOOLFOLK AND GLENNDA CHUI 

Mercury News 


Two energy agencies announced Thursday that they are investigating charges some California generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity, and Atlanta-based Mirant admitted it had a role in last week's incident that briefly imperiled the Western power grid.

California officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on Aug. 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse, threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people. 

But it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again. 

Some generators and a federal official questioned the California Independent System Operator's handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified.

But Stephanie McCorkle with the California agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didn't follow orders. And she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity.

``We asked them over and over why they're not following our dispatch instructions,'' she said, adding that some have provided ``explanations that don't add up. It makes us suspicious.''

McCorkle said the Aug. 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power. That left the Western grid -- a vast network of high-voltage lines, transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of Canada and Mexico -- with a sudden and severe electrical shortage. If uncorrected, she and others said, it could have led to widespread power outages.

Although officials need to keep the grid's electrical frequency at 60 hertz, the Aug. 2 shortage lowered it to 59.93 hertz. State officials said blackouts could occur at 59.65 hertz.

McCorkle declined to name the companies involved. But Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, which has three plants in the Bay Area, said it was partly responsible. While offering few details about what happened, he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ``not making a timely call'' and ``some software problems with our computers.''

``It happens,'' Dorinson said. ``People make mistakes.''

An official with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, one of the agencies investigating the matter, said it views the Aug. 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesn't happen again. The agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order. But at this point, the official said, it's unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion, incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices. 

The official said the agency also wants to know why the California Independent System Operator didn't declare a statewide emergency on Aug. 2 when the promised electricity wasn't delivered. Had it done so, he said, the agency would have had more leverage over the generators.

Some power company representatives complained that the ISO doesn't always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs. For many plants, ``it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up,'' said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman with Reliant Energy of Houston. ``You physically can't do it.''

But ISO officials defended their procedures, and spokesman Gregg Fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on Aug. 2 wouldn't have been feasible.

``This was so quick,'' he said. ``It was less than half an hour total from start to finish, and we were able to deal with it appropriately'' without suffering blackouts.

The incident also is being looked into by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials, which sets rules for managing grids in the region's nearly 1.8 million square miles.

Robert Dintelman, the agency's assistant executive director, said brief electricity fluctuations, such as the one that hit California or worse, occur once or twice a month across the West. On Aug. 1, for example, the frequency dipped to 59.75 in Montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there, Dintelman said.

But he said California's claim that generators aren't following orders is unusual. ``That is alarming,'' he added.

The council can issue fines for some rule violations. But Dintelman said he's not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power.

Nationally, such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak, said Ellen Vancko of the North American Electric Reliability Council. Her group has been pushing Congress to make the system tougher, but the legislation has stalled. Meanwhile, she said, grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide.

Although the motivation for these incidents varies, she said, sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves, ``even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk.''

 Hi Green Roomers!

Great season.  I thought you might like to know that we did in fact finish
at the  top of our league. This season was the first time in 7 years we won
our league.  Some have inquired about a playoff game between the 1st and 2nd
placed teams.  So far I have not found that to be true, but will let you
know ASAP if I hear differently.  Here is a link to the GPSD league and
standings.

http://www.gpsdsoccer.com/

As we discussed at our last game and even though I wanted to leave the
managing to some one else.  Given our success and the fun we are having I am
willing to manage the Greenroom one more season this Fall Season in second
division.

To enter a team we will need to come up with $670 by July 23rd.  So if you
want to keep playing on the team please send me (Jon Gail) a check in the
amount of $50.00 at the address below.  If I collect extra money it will be
used to buy a few new uniforms.

Again great season and thanks to all for making it a positive experience.

Ph: 503-691-8067The FERC apparently has a very short memory:


1.	In its Dec. 15, 2000 Order, FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with FERC.   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov. 1 through April 26 are subject to refund?  The Dec. 15 Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability.  Otherwise, refund potential for transactions over $150/MWh would close after 60 days.  Presumably, liability for transactions under $150/MWh would close after 60 days, too.

Here is the excerpt from the Dec. 15 Order:

"We clarify that, unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the Commission.  The institution of a 60-day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff."  Dec. 15 Order at 58.


2.  	In its Nov. 1 Order, FERC said that it would limit refund liability to seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs---much less opportunity costs---to offset potential refunds.

From the Nov. 1 Order:  "However, should we find it necessary to order refunds, we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs."  Nov. 1 Order at 39.


FERC's July 25 Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding.  Arbitrary and capricious, anyone?

Dear Traders:

  Please be advised that the following worksheet is a summary of transmission ancillary charges.  These charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them.  To figure approximately how much each MW of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied, use the following worksheet, adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost.

  For example:  

   I reserve 55 MW's of Sierra Pacific transmission.
 
  Scheduling Fees:   			(55 MW's x 0.1649) =   9.07
  Reactive Supply and Voltage fees: 	9.1692 x (0.45 x 55) x 0.0234 = 5.31
  Line Losses:				0.0234 x 55 MW's x (anticipate average energy cost so far this month; circa $45) = 57.92
				**Please note that if energy prices are higher, this line loss charge will be higher too;  ie - if prices are at $300, this charge will be 386.10**
 
   TOTAL ANCILLARY:			$ 72.30 for 55 MW's  = $ 1.315 per MW hour of transmission


   

Attached is the worksheet:

                             
            
      

 

 
After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 3800 MW to 4100 MW for HE's 1800 through 2400 for
operating day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest
Generation Urgent pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to
run with these values is HE 1800.  The ISO will update you of any changes in
line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the
Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

Heather,

I participate in this every year with my previous employer. Since moving from Eugene I now commute on the MAX. I would like to commute with my bike on MAX and perhaps the think to do is ride to the MAX and get off the train a few miles outside town and ride in. Do you know if the  Bicycle Transportation Alliance has coordinated with TriMet on this event?  

In any case, count me in. I'll be riding every day.

Hey Guys.

The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels. 

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights. 
 
GeirBecause we're under close watch by El Paso, would you mind looking over this e-mail to Kathy before I send it out? Thanks....

Kathy -

I requested tapes for 8/17 to verify the amount we purchased from SRP, and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power (Vanessa at SRP said she'd need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all) for HE 16-18. 40 mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at Four-Corners. Our records also show we bought 50 mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day. So total SRP purchase for HE 17 is 90 mw (50 mw lending deal + 40 mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements). 

I'm working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers - I'll let you know as soon as we find that. In the meantime, do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased 40 mw of econ energy for HE 17? I'm just not finding anything to support that.

Thanks,

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.
JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/28/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the law." 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing." 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. 
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. 
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. 
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns." 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
"I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.

Group,

Wheelabrator Shasta (WSENGY_1_UNIT4) sold 2mw, on-peak, for Wednesday, 8/8.  They actually won't be able to produce (unit problems), so we need to buy power real-time to cover their day-ahead sale.  So, please purchase 2mw, HE7-22, NP15.  They sold day-ahead at $65, so if you can buy-back for below $65 that would be great.

Gentlemen,

Delano is prescheduled to return from their outage beginning HE7 on Monday, 7/23.  However, if you can buy the energy back HE7-10, below $40 (their variable costs), please do so.  If prices warrant, you will purchase 25mw, SP15, HE7-10.  I will tee up Delano for this play, please stay in contact with the control room to let them know what's going on.

As far as the price goes, we proposed to Delano that we would split the profit with them.  So, split the delta between what you're able to buy for, and their variable costs ($40).  For example, if you're able to purchase the energy at $30, put in a purchase from whoever at $30, then a sale to Delano at $35 (giving Delano $5, and real-time $5).  The Services Desk (out of the goodness of our hearts), is not going to take anything from this transaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have one more issue with Delano on Monday.  HE23-24 they are prescheduled at 20mw, but they will be able to produce 30mw, so we will possibly have 10mw to sell for them.  They are going to let me know what they want to do.  They will either have us sell it real-time, run uninstructed against the ISO dec., or ramp down their generation to reflect their preschedule.

I will keep you posted on what they want to do.

Thanks,
Stan10:30  NCPA - Meet with Al Parsons and Fred Young

Subject:  Copper


After careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers, I
decided to leave Copper on for Friday night 8/18.  There were several
reasons for this decision including the PV outage,  the fact that,
Newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts, and the fact that when we
needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing
it up.  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the
right thing to due given those factors.  If either of you have any
questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me.  Thanks --GUZ

Group,

There are two actions required for Delano Energy on Monday, 7/17.  First, please try to buy-back HE7-10.  They will be running at 25mw HE1-6, and then they are scheduled to ramp up to 45mw beginning HE7.  If you can purchase 20mw for HE7-10 below $40 (their cost to run), please do so.

Second, we need to sell 5mw for HE23-24.  They are prescheduled for 25mw, but they will be actually running at 30mw, so we need to sell 5mw.  Their variable costs are $40, so please try to sell above this level.

Thanks,
StanJohn Malowney would like us to calculate our profits from Montana Power deals for this year. He'd like a number by tomorrow. Let me know if you'd like me to take care of this.

Thanks,
KateHey Bill,

I bought 20 MW spin from Solice at 12:05 PM (HE14 purchase).  At 15:00, I had a conversation with Ken Larson who disputed the sale.  He thought he had sold 25 MW spin.  A few minutes later, he was abusive to Mark.

Sue,

Bill Williams III from the real time desk has asked me to contact you to see if you could ask the ISO to resume publishing the "as bid" and Out Of Market cost information for imbalance energy purchases.  According to Bill's contact at the ISO, Keoni, the ISO made the decision to publish only the proxy price, but not the accepted bids exceeding the proxy price. The "as bid" information needs to be published so that SCs can get real time price signals about imbalance energy charges.  The proxy price is not enough to determine the cost of imbalance energy because the ISO doesn't buy all of its energy at the proxy price.  Some will be purchased at the proxy price, some at bids exceeding the proxy, and some through OOM calls.  Absent this information, SCs incurring imbalance charges will not find out what their costs are for 75 days.Hey why aren't you on MSN instant messenger? What's the deal with that?

Subject:	Real-Time Handsets

Dave,
Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.
First, regarding handsets.  Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets.  Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well.
Also, I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret, and on each RT turret as well.  Also on Stewart Rosman's, Greg Wolf's, Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's.  I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret (this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets). Her TRID is #106 ext. 3939, my TRID is #140 ext. 3730.
I will address our treatment of handsets with the group.
Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time.
Thanks for the help.
BillADS users:

I have received numerous comments from TSWG regarding concerns about the
planned implementation of the same service type for OOS and OOM type
dispatches in ADS phase II .   Market Operations' current position is that
the Market Participants have all the information they need to decode OOS and
OOM, such as what has been bid, what has been dispatched, what proxy bids
have been created based on available capacity, etc.  However, we will
consider a change to separate the OOS and OOM dispatches.  In order to fully
weigh the ramifications of this decision, I want to solicit
examples/scenarios where Market Participant systems would not be able to
correctly settle against a combined OOS/OOM dispatch through ADS.

If you are interested in this issue, please strengthen your case by sending
me an email with comments by 8/16/01.  I would especially like to see
comments regarding how must-offer fits in, including issues with proxy bids
and whether OOM will apply to must offer units.

Thanks,

Hey there!!

Oh I was sooo upset!  It didn't rain, thunder, sprinkle shoot it wasn't even
humid or misty!  I got screwed!  :)  Ok it wasn't all that bad.  I actually
had a really great time.  Imagine someone actually going on vacation to see
it pour rain.  Sick sick individual!

Let's see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil' miss
Nikki to be a spy!  Portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of
down town.  There were so many things to do and see!  Unfortunately because
we didn't exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we
just wondered around aimlessly.


Then on Saturday we all drove to Astoria...you knew I just had to go!!  It
was great!  Absolutely beautiful!  On the way we stopped at the fresh berry
market and had the most amazing berries!!! Oh they were good!  Next we ate
at a little fish place mmmm...clam chowder and fried seafood.  Then went to
Cannon Beach.  What a great little town!  I bought some pulled taffy and
some hot chocolate and was in heaven!  Alot of the beach sites , (for
example Haystack rock) were in the Goonies film.  Then of course I found the
little hotel that "Kindergarten Cop" was filmed in.  what a loser I was
taking pictures like a fool!

Bill you don't understand, for years and years every Saturday after cartoons
I would pop "KC" into the VCR.  I loved it! Ok ok dorky but hey you have to
have some abnormalities in your life.

Then if you haven't been here I am going to be the one to take you for your
first time....if you'll let me.  And hey don't get any wild hairs about
exploring this before hand mister!!!I'm the tour guide on this baby!!! :)
It's outside of Cannon Beach just past Hug point.  It's a little trek called
Falcon Cove.  you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we
went on.

Finally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive
downtown!  Bush Gardens????  Blech!  Horrible I felt like I had licked the
hair on my dogs butt!  Oooo it was just gross.

Then of course I got to meet you.  That was a nice highlight to my trip.
You rate right up there along side the "KC" hotel rooms.  yeah I kinda like
ya!  :)

Next morning I ate the best breakfast of my entire life.  Not kidding!  It's
something like the Otwalia???  It's in the Westin hotel.  Ok we all shared
our plates so this was our breakfasts...Sarah got a fruit plate, I got eggs
benedict and Todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter
and syrup.  Swear to God that is the first place I want to go to eat when I
get to go back.  Ok it was a little pricey though.  Not tooo bad.  it was
31.25 for 3 of us.  Not alot but breakfast is usually like 5 bucks!

The next two days were spent in Hood River/ Cascade Lockes.  We hiked the
Mananomah (whatever) falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around
the town of Stevens,WA.  15 miles!  I was really hurting by that night! 3/4
of the trail was up hill!  Oh my tail end hurt like crazy!  In Steven's we
ate at a little snack shop.  It was probably one of the better places!  Oh
what was it's name???  Oh Little Viking's.  Really cute place.  You've gotta
go!  Oh one more that I won't recommend...Tugboat Annie's in Hood River.
Again I felt like I had given an ATB to someone!  Too fancy.  I'm a meat and
potatoe girl.  That fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over
do it.

WE ate at Stanford's the last day and it was another fancy place.  I ordered
onion rings and they were good.  The salad was horrible!  So on a food
rating scale POrtland/Oregon recieves a 70%.  I guess I'm just not going to
the right places.

As you can tell by the length of this I am at work and needing to use some
of my time up!  You are the poor sap I've chosen since you don't know me
yet.

Well the move out date is set for me.  I move out on July 31.  I'm not too
sure when the townhouse will be available though so I'm playing it by ear.
DO you have any idea when your trip out there might fall?  If you have a
ball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates.  I just want
to be sure that I'm off of work as much as possible the day or days that you
have elected to spend with me.  That is if you still want to spend them with
me.  I mean I did sort of stalk your house and found out where you
lived....that can't be good! :)

Ok I honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation.  I'm just
sort of a small town girl who knows that those things really aren't
appropriate but do them regardless.  You'll understand once we become better
friends!  I warned you a little though.  I did say that I was spontaneous
and might just show up on your doorstep.  Well there you go I did!

Please don't tell Brendan.  You probably already did!  I actually need to
E-mail him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you.
The small amount of time I got to spend with you was very nice.  I look
forward to doing that again sometime.  We'll just up hte time slot a hair.

Ok I will let your weary eyes seetle back to work.  Oh I did receive your
voicemail on my phone but it was in NM.  I wouldn't have had time anyhow but
thank you for your hospitality and the offer.  I can't wait to reciprocate
it in CAli.!

Take care,
Nikki

I wanted to let everyone know that Lavorato has organized a "trader boondoggle" for next weekend.  He has invited electricity traders with primary book responsibility from the east desk, west desk, ees wholesale, and alberta.  I was limited on both the job function of the people that could go as well as the total number from our desk that could go.  I know that many people would like to go on such a boondoggle.  I also feel that everyone here works hard and is equally committed to our success and arguably deserves such a boondoggle.  Unfortunately, I only received five slots for Portland west ena traders.

Next Friday morning Bob Badeer, Matt Motley, Mike Swerzbin, Mark Fischer, and I will be boarding a plane and heading to Cabo for the weekend.  We will be returning Sunday night and will be in the office for normal hours on Monday.

Tim
After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4020 MW to 4300 MW and in the (S-N) direction was
changed from 2450 MW to 3675 MW for HE's 2100 through 2400 for operating day
8/13/01.  The reason(s) for the change is the line work is finished.  This
applies to real time only.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,

We'll be short 50 mw (25 under STWBOM, 25 under STSW) for Friday and Saturday. On peak hours. Price is $64.60. Purchases from El Paso have been entered under both desks. Please reduce the STWBOM purchase price (704426) to $4 after purchasing energy in the market. (Adjust price accordingly if you buy from El Paso.) Sell back to El Paso at a zero price. Here are the deals:

704426 - STWBOM buys EPE
704432 - STWBOM sells STSW
704441 - STSW buys EPE

It appears this arrangement has been working quite well over the past few days (making money, not errors). Keep up the good work!

Subject:	RE: Two Major Inconsistencies in FERC's Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov 1 and Dec 15 Orders

Hi Dave,

Of course the decision is politically motivated.  But aren't they all?  It's just that now it's our ox being gored.

In general, review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential, i.e., court's give agencies a lot of discretion---which is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision.  But if a court concludes that the agency's action was "arbitrary and capricious" it may overturn the decision.  Our argument would be that FERC is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregarded---without explanation---its earlier rulings in this case.  It's no slam dunk, but it's the best argument we have.  We will never win an argument in any court that FERC "could have" or "should have" crafted its order a certain way; a court will almost always say, "the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit."  However, courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of Constitutional Due Process.

As for the public's opinion of Enron as a profiteer---for better or worse it's already established.  And no matter what action we take, Davis will cast a negative spin on it.  So why not fight for our interests?  The stakes in this order are worth it.  This recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model (power marketing); it's hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs.  The generators get to offset refunds with input costs, we should be able to use our purchased power costs.  I don't see much downside for us to argue that FERC should keep its word that (1) refunds can only be ordered within 60 days, and (2) all sellers are entitled to marginal costs.  We are just holding the Commission to its promise.  At a minimum, the Commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings.

These are good questions.  Have a good weekend. 

(I copied Alan on this because I thought he might be interested in our colloquoy.)

Steve,

Aside from the fact that the entire play by the FERC in the last 3 months has been purely politically motivated, are we going to challenge the latest rulings in court?  Can we challenge this apparent lack of consistency (memory loss)?

If we were to challenge do you think the general "public" opinion and impression of Enron as a henious profiteer from Houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challenge?

Just curious about what your thoughts/planned recommendation are.

Thanks for the information,

Subject:	Two Major Inconsistencies in FERC's Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov 1 and Dec 15 Orders

The FERC apparently has a very short memory:


1.	In its Dec. 15, 2000 Order, FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with FERC.   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov. 1 through April 26 are subject to refund?  The Dec. 15 Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability.  Otherwise, refund potential for transactions over $150/MWh would close after 60 days.  Presumably, liability for transactions under $150/MWh would close after 60 days, too.

Here is the excerpt from the Dec. 15 Order:

"We clarify that, unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the Commission.  The institution of a 60-day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff."  Dec. 15 Order at 58.


2.  	In its Nov. 1 Order, FERC said that it would limit refund liability to seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs---much less opportunity costs---to offset potential refunds.

From the Nov. 1 Order:  "However, should we find it necessary to order refunds, we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs."  Nov. 1 Order at 39.


FERC's July 25 Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding.  Arbitrary and capricious, anyone?


Steve


Alan:  Please forward to Dan Watkiss and Ron Carroll. 


As we have moved into the shoulder months of September and October we need to be aware that the El Paso load curve is shifting.  This means you will slowly start seeing a greater morning ramp than in the past few months.  We need to keep this in mind and utilize the dispatch and load curves supplied to us by El Paso to ensure a smooth morning ramp.  For the past two days the night shift has oversold for HE 6 to the point of having to turn on the steamers both days.  There is no reason that we shold be selling HE 6 and turning on the steamers at the same time.   Be very careful NOT TO OVERSELL FOR HE 6.  If you have any questions about load curves feel free to talk with Bill or a senior member of the group.  Cheers---GUZThe following appointments have been made for your meetings in Portland.

Thanks,
KateDue to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours, we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec. bidding or buying-back generation that you've sold forward.  We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy.  As the weather turns cold during the late-Autumn and Winter months, the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market.

Lately, HE1-10 have been very weak real-time, ranging between $25 and $40.  We have two strategies that we would like to suggest:

1.  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec. bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate.  Basically, we would be letting the ISO know that we're willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw's from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity.  You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it from the ISO.  For example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If the ISO takes the decremental bid, and the price is $30, then you make $20/MWh.   

Advantages - A relatively large upside, the price the ISO charges could actually go negative, as large as negative $91.87.  Also, you would actually be buying from the ISO, as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk.

Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch.  When we submit decremental bids, the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes.  In addition to the physical problems this might create, the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow.

2.  Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market:
This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate.  This would call for you to reduce your generation, and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity.  Once again, you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy.   As in the previous example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If we can buy-back the energy for a price of $30, then you make $20/MWh.   Additionally, if we do buy-back the energy, we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order.  Then, if the ISO takes the incremental bid, you can generate the power and sell for additional profit. 

Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch (unless a supplemental bid is accepted).  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced.  Also, the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage.

Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding.

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy #2, buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market.  Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy, then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO.  We propose a 50/50 profit split, above your day-ahead profit, earned from either of these two strategies.

If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster.

The Montana Power Company
40 East Broadway Street
Butte, Montana  59701-9394

	Re:	 Arrangements to Accommodate FERC's June 19, 2001 Order

Dear ____________________:

	The Montana Power Company ("MPC") and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI") are parties to a Confirmation Letter dated December 20, 1999 (the term of which has been extended by letter dated __________________) under which EPMI has been purchasing energy for resale to MPC or selling energy received from MPC into the wholesale market.  As you are no doubt aware, the FERC issued an Order on June 19, 2001 that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the WSCC.  

One restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers, such as EPMI, may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the California ISO ("California Cap").  Generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices.  As a result, at times (such as during this week's heat wave which caused blackouts in Las Vegas) EPMI may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the West at a price below the California Cap.  Because EPMI cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the California Cap to MPC, we cannot purchase such energy on MPC's behalf for resale to MPC.  

However, in order to continue to serve MPC's needs at times of peak demand, scarce supply, and high prices, EPMI proposes the following solution:

1.	If EPMI is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the California Cap, EPMI will strive to meet MPC's energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to MPC and for MPC to pay the generator directly. 
2.	EPMI will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer, who will be paying the generator directly for that energy.
3.	EPMI will notify MPC of the identity of the seller, along with the amount to be paid the seller, and provide other information and assistance to enable MPC to pay the seller directly. 
4.	All other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged.
 
	We believe this proposal allows EPMI to continue to meet MPC's needs, while complying with Federal law.  If you have another proposal, or would like to discuss this matter further, please feel free to call either Christian Yoder at (503) 464-7845 or Steve Hall at (503) 464-7795.  

Otherwise, kindly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to this amendment by signing in the place provided below.

Deals done under the EPMI Short Term West Hourly desk do not need to be confirmed. The Real Time traders know they need to check "No" in the Confirmation box in Deal Entry; however, it's one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked. It occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of Real Time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed - and unnecessarily confusing counterparties - if we could make "No confirmation" an automatic default for all deals entered under the Short Term West Hourly book. 

I can't think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change, but let's discuss that during the next Enpower meeting. Please let me know what we can do to get this implemented.

Thanks for your help,

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening;

I started working in June 22 to test path cut capabilities.  I was able to save a cut path.  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready. Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time.

A Real Time Question:
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance, as it sometimes is at night, will this application still function?  If not, we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained.


Re-Running June 20th as a completely new day: This entire test was done in local Enpower

PreSchedule Workspace:

Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got "List index out of bounds (4)" error *needs fix
	
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states "ERROR:" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message)

Daily Summary Function

Routing:*accepted Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12



Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the "ok" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confrim button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

 Several generators will have energy available for the weekend because day ahead prices did not reach their thresholds so they scheduled less than the amount available.  If Real TIme prices do exceed their thresholds, please call them and buy their power and ramp them up.  Sunday looks like it will happen for a good piece of the peak hours so focus on Sunday.  You will need to inc their gen schedules.

Saturday
Delano:  			15 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45
Wheelabrator Martell		6 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $50.  Pre-schedule 7MW, increase to 13
Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $70.  Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2

Sunday 
Delano:  			15 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45
Wheelabrator Martell		6 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $50.  Pre-schedule 7MW, increase to 13
Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $70 Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2


Monday
Delano:  			15 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45

Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $70 Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2

In addition, it is possible that any of these units, or Harbor could be dispatched by the ISO pursuant to the FERC order.  This will probably not occur as the ISO will not need their energy over the weekend, but if it does, we should relay these instructions to the generator, ramp them up and put a deal in the system as we would a supplemental.  This should be a pass through for EPMI.

Jim and Darren,

We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.  We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345. This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report. I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report, these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report. The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift. I prefer to not enter these extra deals. Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists.

As you may already know, the Short Term West Hourly desk began trading the Enron Online hourly market on Monday. These deals should be treated just like all Short Term West Hourly deals - they do not need to be confirmed. Unfortunately, it seems the EOL application created for us is defaulting to "Yes-Confirm," and West Hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters. 

I've spoken with the EOL help desk about changing this default setting, and they've informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change. In the meantime, I wanted to make you aware of these deals' existence. You will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the Short Term West Hourly desk in the future, and many of these will be made on EOL. Again, these should be treated as with any other West Hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this. I'll let you know as soon as I've heard more conclusive information from EOL. And thanks for your help.

Jim,
Harbor and Martel were declined with the CISO for 06/08/01 HE 1 and HE 2.  The reasons: for Harbor the CISO inc'd them to 10, and ignored their operating limits as entered at 60 and 80.  Martel was inc'd but could not ramp up.  Both bids were properly entered by were ignored by the CISO.  Delano was incd'd and dec'd several times in the morning and was able to respond.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Elsie - 

  Can you get ahold of your contact at Mirant and find out the following:

  We had a cut at HE 11 on 6-2-01.  PAC cut a schedule to Mirant that was to come to us at EPMI and we were sending to WAPA.  Mirant didn't call us until HE 12 and they said that they booked it out with WAPA.  Now WAPA is not showing the bookout.  Can you get the name of the trader at Mirant who booked it out with WAPA, the time of the conversation and the name of the person they talked to at WAPA?  Also, if they have the time of their call to us, that would be great.


  Thanks Elsie,

  Virginia


  By the way, if it would be easier, I can call your contact at MIRANT.Bill-

  Please come see me this morning with your comments or suggestions on the LP deal.
  As it is month-end and we have many other things to finish by today, I need to get this off my desk.

Arco is going down for a few hours in the morning on Thursday, 8/23 to conduct some maintenance.  They are prescheduled at 26mw, but from HE 2-9, they will only be able to produce 10mw.  So, please reduce their generation schedule, and purchase 16mw, HE2-9, in SP15 for them.

Also, for HE3-6, of those 16mw that you purchase for Arco, please sell 11mw to ST West Services (deal #744709), and then sell to Arco (deal #744714) for the same price that you sold to West Services.  The remainder just sell straight to Arco.  This needs to be done because there were some funky schedule adjustments by the ISO.  Basically, the ISO cut Arco's day-ahead schedule by 11mw for HE3-6, so West Services had wear that in order for the day-ahead Enpower to Caps report to tie out.

One more thing, the ISO also adjusted several other generator schedules for HE3-6, on Thursday, 8/23.  I emailed the generators who were affected (Sierra, Wheelabrator Martel, and Nove).  I told them that we resubmitted all their schedules in the hour ahead market, and that we were relatively confident that their preferred schedules would be awarded hour ahead.  But if they so desired, they could call into the real-time desk one hour before the flow to check the hour-ahead final.  That way the could make any adjustments to their generation if necessary.  So, you might get a few calls in the middle of the night from a few generators to check their final hour-ahead schedules.  But to be honest, I highly doubt you'll get any calls.  I know you won't get a call from Nove or Sierra, if you do get a call it might be from Wheelabrator Martel.

We have a fantastic opportunity for employees of our sponsors and suite
holder companies.  Due to last minute scheduling conflicts, a large
block of our volunteers for the Party at PGE Park this coming Friday had
to cancel.  This has obviously created some last minute challenges for
PGE Park, but it is a great opportunity for your employees to volunteer
a few hours of their time on behalf of some great causes plus see the
Four Tops and The Spinners in concert for FREE.  Here's how:

Party at PGE Park is a fundraiser for the Portland Oregon Sports
Authority, SOLV, and Special Olympics Oregon.  
We are about 40 volunteers short to assist with serving the VIP dinner.

Volunteers would work from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on assisting with the
pre-concert food service.
In exchage, each volunteer will get two free tickets to that evenings'
concert plus a voucher for a free hot dog, chips, and soda.

This opportunity is open to your employees and spouses, significant
others, or other adult family members.  We're sorry, but children cannot
volunteer for this particular opportunity.

Interested parties can call or e-mail:

BillTrader on this deal is Bert Meyers. I've left him a message to come in a little early for the meeting today so we can settle this. However, it looks like everything on our side has been taken care of - Virginia says both Montana and Tacoma agree HE 3 should be zeroed out, which is what we show in Enpower. It appears we've been charged for the change in sale volume, but not credited for the change in purchase volume - am I right?

So at this point do we need to bother the trader with this? And what do you mean by "it" being "in or out"? Another deal? We shouldn't need one.

Let me know when you get a chance.

Good point Bill.  Now that we are sure what happened to #549162.1 is correct, I am following up with Settlements group in Houston regarding the other side of the deal, i.e. #549160.  Somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them, but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty.

If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.
BillLes,

FYI, LV COGEN went off line @ 15:00.  We called SRP to inform them of the cut and Vanessa said she sees the schedule as unit contingent so she agreed to go to zero on the schedule.

Following are two glitches the Real Time group has run across with the Forward Obs report. As I understand, Dave Poston is getting set to roll out a new version of Enpower Position Manager, which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run (Forward Obs included), but in the meantime these are the problems we've seen. Thanks so much for your help on this!

1. REPORT NOT READING TWO IDENTICAL STRIPS - When deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours, same volume, same price and same counterparty (using the same deal number), the report only reads one strip. For example, on 8/6/01, deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the California Imbalance for 50 mw HE 7-12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for HE 13-22. The report read all 50 mw HE 7-12, but only 25 mw HE 13-22. I zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw. 

Another example, on 8/4/01, deal 718205 is a purchase from EES HE 21-22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each. Again, the report read only one of these, and I eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours.

Due to the nature of Real Time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price. So I'm hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms. Please let me know if this is feasible.

2. REPORT NOT READING SALES AT THE BC BORDER - This is a new one that cropped up this morning. We made a purchase from a counterparty at the BPA Busbar, wheeled the power to the BC Border and sold it there. For some reason, although all three deals (724366/724368/724367) appear in Deal Entry and Scheduling, the sale at the BC Border does not show up in the Forward Obligation report. After looking into this, I've found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report. I'm wondering if this is related to deals done at the BC Border, although I don't recall seeing this problem before.

Again, please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed. I look forward to our next conference call....

Couple of questions....

1.  Will this date work for your respective groups?

2.  Do you have an idea of who from your group should attend or you would like to have attend?  (I will open it up to the entire floor, but just want to get an initial headcount.)

[Bill - would you please take a look at the text below and fill in the needed information.  Please let me know if we've left anything out. When we've got all the info., we will run it by legal and post on the web site.] 


Text for new pop-up (to run next Monday-Tuesday, August 27-28):

Hourly Products for US West Physical Power Now Available

EnronOnline has introduced new hourly products to help you manage short-term risk in the US West Physical Power market.

The following delivery points are currently available: [list delivery points]
These products will trade from xx:xx to xx:xx [time zone], [days of week].

Please take a few minutes to review the product long descriptions before transacting these products. 

For more information, please click here [open new browser window and link to http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/ContactEnronOnline/].Bill,  

The following is a message that Heather sent to me after we talked about this deal and she did some additional research. A synopsis of this deal:

Geir entered the deal on 4-24-01.  Buy $320, sell $30, creating a $290.00 per MW charge to your books 
You went back on 4-27-01 and corrected the sel price to $300, changing the $290.00 charge to your books to a $20 per MW charge to your book.
Since this is an intra-month change, Portland Risk should recognize this when the compare it to their LiqRec report and they should recognize a $108,000 credit back in your PMA's.  (Since the change was done before month-end, this never hit settlements to pull thru for DPR because by the time Settlements looked at it, it was correct.)

My point here is that you WILL see this credit in your PMA's, you just haven't yet.  With the transition of people in Risk, one of the functions that got delayed was the true-up between the LiqRec report and the end of the month intra-month changes report, which is where your variance is sitting now.  Risk is aware that this is out there and they are doing their best to true these types of things up.  As of today, they are working back to January.  Right now, they can't give me a timeline of when this will be recognized, but please be assured that they are working on it.  

Heather has requested that if you have specific questions, that you direct them to her.  She will also let you know as soon as she has a good idea of when they will be caught up.

Please also feel free to ask me any questions about the processes.  I'll help you in any way that I can.
Thanks for pointing this out to us.  Anything that can help us to stay on top of these processes is always a plus.

Virginia





Also concerning W-BOM 590753.
What happens when a deal is changed in the same month after the flow date - Risk can calculate the difference and add it to the Liquidation value.
Or what happens is that we Re-Run the reports for Customers and Desk-to-Desk and Compare to another report called the LiqRec (Liquidation Reconcilation) the differences we should run through the books.  
John is working on that.  He is starting in Jan. - So you can let Bill know that yes it has not come through yet - and Risk will enter that.
I will give him a better timeline of when that will happen when I know.

Thanks for all of your help on this Virginia.

Mike Brochaus is the manager of the team, so if you want to play show your
interest by showing up at the first game. I believe the cost to play is $50.
Also if you want to play you need to bring a white and maroon color shirt to
every game in case we need to change colors.  Hope to see you there.
 
JonFYI -

We've added Burke (Mid-Columbia) as a new delivery point in Enpower. I know some of you have already traded at this point, so if you have a record of the deals you've entered, it might be a good idea to go back and correct the delivery point to read "Burke."

Thanks,
KateFor Wednesday:

We're short tomorrow on peak at Palo Verde - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW. Please puchase to fill these schedules; reduce the purchases from EPE to $4 (711216 and 711225); sell back to EPE at $0. You will know you've done this correctly when the CARP report EXACTLY matches the El Paso model. Following are the details of the lending agreement:

711216 - STWBOM buys EPE

KateAccording to BPA we are almost their on Grays. The only change is that Enron needs to report the total generator output which as indicated on the prescheduled sheet is 6Mw. One Mw is going to Grays Harbor PUD and we have no responsibility other than to report the total generator output.

I've sent to BPA on a prescheduled basis all the prescheduled so that shouldn't be a issue.

The good news is that on Oct. 1 Grays will no longer be our customer and BPA is saying they'll have a automatic system in place to record these numbers automatically by Mid August so hang in there.

Thanks,
StacyISO Market Participants:
Since Trade Month November 2000 (which settled beginning in January 2001),
payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than the
full amount due Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) in the monthly cash clearing
process.  The purpose of this message is to describe the ISO's policies and
procedures in settling the market when defaults occur.
As set forth in Section SABP 6.7.4 of the ISO Tariff, when payment defaults
occur from SCs that have obligations to the ISO's markets (Debtor SCs), the
shortfall is to be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them (Creditor SCs)
based on their outstanding balances. The principles that drive how amounts
are settled and defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below:
Proportionate allocation of defaults - The total amount of market defaults
is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each
Creditor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount
receivable for the month.  SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on
a monthly basis as described below.  The intent of the Tariff is to
equitably distribute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net
market receivables for the period.
Each month is treated as a whole period - Final and preliminary invoices are
combined when possible (see exception conditions below) in allocating market
defaults.  Cash payments from the market are received in two stages
(preliminary and final).  At preliminary, market payments are distributed
based on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the
preliminary invoices. Final invoices serve essentially as true-ups to the
preliminary invoices, and accordingly, payments received at final are
redistributed to the extent possible to achieve true-up allocations for the
whole month considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both
the preliminary and final invoices.
Each month is treated as a discrete period - Market defaults are generally
allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being
settled.  The exceptions to this rule involve (1) SCs that are Creditor SCs
in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods
or (2) Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for
prior months.  In the first instance, the Creditor SC would not be paid to
the extent of default obligations from prior months.  Amounts due to the
Creditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds
would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period. In
the second instance the current month's payment is carried back and applied
first to the oldest outstanding balance. The proceeds would be distributed
to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs unpaid
balances in that month.  With respect to the carry back of payments to the
earliest period, Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from
different SCs.
GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments  - GMC is
billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final
invoices each month.  In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices
(at either preliminary or final), market funds are transferred to satisfy
GMC obligations before any market distributions are made.  This first
priority position for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP 6.3.1.3 of
the ISO Tariff.  Therefore, when both GMC and market defaults occur (as has
occurred in each of the past few months), the Creditor SCs have two
reductions to the market clearing amounts ultimately paid - an allocated
portion of the GMC default, and an allocated portion of the market default.
RMR invoices and payments are not affected by market or GMC defaults - The
RMR invoicing process involves amounts due from the PTO's to the RMR Owners
as set forth in monthly invoices processed through the ISO's systems.
However, such amounts are invoiced independent of the ISO's market and GMC
billing processes, and accordingly, market and/or GMC defaults do not impact
RMR related payments.
There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of
allocating cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur.  Some of these factors
include:
*	amounts received after payment date deadlines - such amounts are
typically included in the next distribution
*	market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the
current month - such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount
of the GMC default by the Creditor SC
*	allocations to prior months - not made unless the amount exceeds
0.5% of that months billed amounts
*	small invoices under $5,000 are paid in full rather than the
allocated percentage.
For more information about these allocation issues or any other related
matters, please contact Melodie Iverson (916) 351-2174 (e-mail
mkiverson@caiso.com <mailto:miverson@caiso.com> ) or Mike Epstein (916)

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?

Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.Elsie -

I have a question regarding our desk's PMA report for July. We've incurred three charges under the heading "DPR rate actualization." Virginia Thompson in Volume Management has informed me that these have to do with BPA transmission reservations; however, I was wondering if you might be able to further clarify this charge for me (your initials appear next to the individual explanations) or point to someone who can. I assume the charges, which total $1,819 (including a credit for $100) have something to do with line loss payback. But I'd like to know how this is calculated.

Please let me know if you can assist.

As much as I'd like to, I can't get to every floor or to every location across Enron to talk with you about what is going on around the company.  So I'm doing the next best thing.  Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning Enron Broadband Services.  As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely.  I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e-mail for future messages.  Thanks for listening and have a great day.

Thanks,
KateReal Time Traders,


This Saturday 7/28 Frontier needs to repay BPA for Control Area reserves that where used on 6/30 and 7/21. The total Frontier owes is 32 Mw. I've arranged with BPA to return 2 Mw on peak for Saturday.

However, this payback needs to be done Real Time as BPA's ability to take the energy is dependant on their system operations. 

The Real Time procedure is as follows:

1) Call the BPA Real Time power scheduler at 503-230-3341 around 0400 or 0500 and tell him you are calling to schedule energy imbalance paybacks from Frontier Energy for 2 Mw On Peak. If BPA can take the schedule try to get them to commit to take all 16 hours. Then call BPA Real Time transmission and buy a 2 Mw wheel using account # 805608 for Energy Imbalance paybacks to BPA merchant. 

If BPA is unable to take the 2 Mw schedule for any hour please sell it Real Time for the best price in the Northwest. 

2) In Enpower enter a buy from Frontier at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal. Enter a sale to BPA at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy Imbalance Payback deal. Extend BPA transmission deal 704168 to include the additional 2 mw.

Call me if there are questions or problems. We tried to do this payback last Saturday and the energy just went inadvertent for 3 hours because we didn't call BPA.

x36245 Hi Guys,

  I was hoping one of you could help me solve a deal.....
 The following is my understanding of what happened:

  On 5-2-01 (Wednesday), CONAGRA called EPMI's scheduling group about a cut to a day-ahead schedule for HE 7.
  Cara took the call and told Conagra that the cut had to be done Real-Time because it was the day of flow.
  Cara transferred the call to Real time.

  I was wondering if any of you took a call regarding a cut for HE 7 to one of our schedules going to Conagra? (it must have been somewhere at the very beginning of your shift).  Conagra says they talked to a male real time.  
  I find no cut information in the discussion database or in writing and no cuts in EnPower.  Unfortunately, I cannot check the Lotus Notes Schedule information in the Database because this day is one of the days that is missing.  
  Conagra is charging us $6,625.00 LD's for having to resupply themselves.  I've asked them to pull their tapes and tell me who they talked to EPMI Real Time.   Just thought I'd get the story from our side in the mean time.

    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

Roger; the following contacts will be able to assist Air Products during the term of our physical transaction scheduled to begin on 8/23/01.  


Real-Time;	1-800-684-1336 Managed by Mr. Bill Williams (503) 464-3730

Pre-Schedule;	1-877-464-7779  Managed by Cara Semperger (503) 464-3814.

Donald Robinson (503) 464-3902 and Diana Scholtes (503) 464-3807 will be involved with the "pre-scheduling" of Air Products energy.

My office phone number is (503) 464-2270 with a cellular phone number of (503) 701-0295.

A general rule of thumb would be, we pre-schedule the next day's energy by 6:30 AM PPT the day prior to delivery, except for on Thursday mornings we pre-schedule Friday and Saturday, and on Friday we pre-schedule Sunday and Monday.  Holidays are pre-scheduled by the specific Holiday but if you'll check with us in advance, we'll be able to provide with the pre-schedule deadline.  Air Products is free to make changes at anytime, and internally we will get the request to the appropriate person.

Thanks again for the opportunity to become Air Products Energy Provider of choice, let me know if you have any questions and or concerns.

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

"It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable."
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.

709310 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH/PV
	 25 mw @ $55

709314 - STSW buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $55

These deals have been entered day-ahead, as well as a STSW sale of 50 mw somewhere in the market. Then, in the hour-ahead market, we'll need to procure this energy elsewhere and enter deals under the appropriate desk. We'll reduce the El Paso purchases (709300/709314) to $4 and sell back to El Paso at $0, creating a $4 delta which constitutes the lending fee. Please let Bill, Holden, or me know if you have any questions.

I, too, am for moving up.  Also, I play pick-up with a group of people,
three or four of whom could really help us heighten the level of play, if I
can recruit them.

As for practices, Justin Kerr and coach the varsity boys at Oregon Episcopal

School off SW Scolls Ferry Rd.  Our fall practices run until 5:15 PM, after
which the Green Room may be able use the fields.  Justin is chummy with the
Athletic Director, so we'll see what we can do (they're pretty nice fields).

IN OTHER NEWS, I am in the process of moving.  This weekend I found a
beautiful 4BR, 3BA house in the SW hills on a big chunk of land.  It's got a

garage, terraced lawn, wood floors, etc.  However, I don't have three
roommates.  If anyone on the team or their friends is looking for a place,
let me know if they might be interested in pursuing this house (It's
$500/month +util. +dep. for each of the four people).

Western power grid has close call
Delivery problem could have led to blackouts throughout region 
Stern warning issued to power generators who didn't deliver last week; federal investigation urged. 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK <mailto:jwoolfolk@sjmercury.com> AND STEVE JOHNSON <mailto:sjohnson@sjmercury.com>
Mercury News 
The Western power grid serving 65 million people nearly collapsed a week ago when generators failed to deliver promised electricity -- a problem California officials warned Wednesday is occurring with alarming frequency. 
Last Thursday's close call could have knocked out power in 14 states and parts of Canada and Mexico, causing the region's worst outages in five years. 
``You're standing on the edge of a cliff when a generator fails to do what you order them to do,'' said Jim Detmers, vice president of grid operations at the California Independent System Operator. ``It's not just California that's at risk. It's the whole Western United States.'' 
The dire warning comes as California's energy crisis seems to be easing, with not one of the predicted blackouts rolling across the state so far this summer. 
The intricately balanced system came so close to failure last Thursday that an unexpected outage at just one generator anywhere in the region could have triggered blackouts, Detmers said. 
Air-traffic analogy 
Detmers likened the problem to airliners ignoring orders from the air-traffic control tower. The ISO controls the California grid, scheduling delivery of electricity much as control towers schedule airplanes for landings. 
``It's really no different than if a plane comes into San Francisco International Airport and doesn't follow the rules of the air traffic controller,'' Detmers said. ``We had a near miss on our system. You had two planes getting very close.'' 
Although the ISO has seen similar problems as far back as December, last week's event prompted grid managers to fire a stern warning late Wednesday to California's power generators and to call for federal regulators to investigate. 
The warning cited ``a growing pattern among market participants'' of ``untenable acts'' that include ``failure to comply with dispatch instructions.'' 
``Such system performance threatens the reliability of the Western Interconnection and cannot be tolerated,'' the ISO report said. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said he hadn't been notified of the grid manager's concerns, but after being read language in the report, said it was ``pretty strong stuff coming from the ISO.'' 
Jan Smutny-Jones, a former ISO official who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents generators, said he was unaware of the reported problems but agreed the matter is a serious one. 
``The issue that the ISO is identifying here, I can't recall ever seeing that before,'' Smutny-Jones said, adding that it is crucial to ``get to the bottom of what the problem is and fix it quick.'' 
``System reliability is important to everybody,'' he said. 
Companies not named 
Grid officials would not name the companies involved or say whether they believe the problems resulted from confusion or attempts to manipulate the system to boost market prices. The offenders were reported to federal regulators who will make that call, Detmers said. 
Smutny-Jones said the problem may stem from lingering confusion among energy sellers over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's June 19 order extending price controls throughout the West. 
``I don't think anybody is deliberately trying to put the system in jeopardy,'' Smutny-Jones said. ``There is some confusion and some controversy around.'' 
Grid managers cited two recent examples of problems that are threatening the stability of the system. In one case, a generator scheduled far more power than it was capable of delivering and fell more than 1,600 megawatts short. A megawatt is enough to power some 750 homes or more. 
In another case, a generator balked at an ISO order to deliver power needed to stabilize the system. 
Because electricity must be used as it is produced, the grid manager must precisely match power supply with demand throughout the day. A mismatch can trigger circuit breakers throughout the system, causing widespread blackouts. 
The last major failure on the Western grid was on July 2, 1996, when a tree growing too close to a high-voltage line in Idaho sparked outages across the region affecting 2 million customers. 
Managers' goal 
Grid managers aim to keep the system running at a frequency of 60 hertz. It normally fluctuates between 60.01 and 59.99 hertz, Detmers said. Last Thursday, it fell to 59.93 hertz. 
Blackouts can begin when it gets down to 59.65 hertz, he said. Every loss of 1,000 megawatts costs the system .10 hertz, he said. 
A substantial drop in frequency can cause widespread outages that can take days to fix, he said. 
To maintain balance, the ISO must keep supply and demand within 117 megawatts, Detmers said. Last Thursday, the system slipped more than 1,100 megawatts out of balance for more than 10 minutes and was as much as 1,500 megawatts off.

<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>
<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>Hi Bill,

Sorry I haven't been alive earlier but it's been busy, busy here too. 

After leaving Portland we went to NY for a few days and we got here in Houston during the weekend of the flood but we were lucky not to get any of that. In fact I was suprised when I saw the news the next morning.

First thing,  I checked my past paychecks and you were correct, I have been receiving the 10% extra for shift work. I apologize for bringing it up in our meeting as I did not know anything about it. I did not receive any explanation that I was going to get it for shift work and I never check my paychecks in detail anyway.  
Thanks for sitting with me in that meeting too. I had a good time working in real time.  

Work here is fine. It is a new market that Enron is exploring, that of paper and pulp and trading is fairly thin. I do market analysis for pulp traders and it includes intensive news-reading and passing on important info and gathering of the data and compiling spreadsheets, creating graphs and so on. I like it a lot, I take a lot of the reading home.  I get to do some travelling too both in the US and overseas, and I like that too. I like the people in my group and they help me when I don't know stuff. One good thing about being here is that there are a lot of classes offered and I am going to be in some of them. 

Texas is different for sure but we like it. Yes it is hot but I feel like home. We have been out a bit and went to Dallas last weekend to visit some cousins. There is a lot of spanish around here, you hear it everywhere so I decided to learn it  and I am going to start it this week, twice a week. It's great beacuse when I learn new words I can practice with my latin co-workers.

That's pretty much it for now. 

When is evaluation taking place? How are things there, I bet much busier. 

Let me know,
cheers,
Monika

Thanks - looks like we will need to put an annuity in for the value of this deal between you and STCA -
The others I am tracking down.

Heather I have gone through the PMA's and portions of them look appropriate, however, I would appreciate it if you could look into a couple of deals for me.

First:
ST-WHOURLY
02/24/01--Deal# 530686 and 530687.  When Mark Guzman originally made these deals he neglected to put in a 35 mw purchase from WWP at $200 for HE 1-6.  He also neglected to put in the 35 mw sale to Wesco at $275.  The PMA shows the cost for the 35 mw purchase from WWP at $200, but does not show the revenue from the 35 mw sale to Wesco at $275.  These changes were put in at the same time on the same day per Virginia.  This is approximately $57,750.

03/22/01--Deal #558190.  David Porter originally put this deal in as a buy from ST-CALI.  The deal should have been a buy from EES.  I changed the counterparty only, approximately 2 hours after the flash.  The charge of $18750 is the entire charge for the deal (25 mws at $125 for HE 1-6).  If I am charged by EES, I believe I should receive revenue from ST-CALI for the expense that went out with the flash.

ST-WBOM
04/24/01--Deal #590753.  Geir Solberg entered a buy-resale for $320 and $30...I corrected this to 320 and 300 for a difference of $20 on 04/27/01.  This represents a $108,000 change for the better.

There may be more, but this is all I have for now.
Again, I appreciate you taking the time to look into these.

Thanks,

BillYup, everyone is invited to play with the high schoolers Thursdays at 6 PM.  
OES is out Scholls Ferry Road a half mile past the Beav-Hills Highway, turn 
left on Nicol Road, follow to the end.  Hope to see y'all there.

Bill,
I just wanted to let you know that it's going to take a couple weeks (I think) until I receive access to the timekeeping system.  Apparently after requesting access, ISC sends back a ticket number and an FYI (below).  
As soon as I receive access I will go back for your group and enter their time, and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month.

Thanks, Jill

<Embedded Microsoft Clip Gallery>I will be holding an information session on the midyear PRC process.  The purpose of the information session is to provide an overview of the PRC process from selecting reviewers to final PRC meetings in Houston.  New employees may find it useful as I will try to explain how the process works and will attempt to provide some useful background.  People who have been here for a while may also find it useful.  This year I am on the company-wide Performance Review Committee, so I have had the opportunity to provide input into the process and sit in on PRC meetings throughout the company.  I will discuss changes to this year's PRC process and share my observations of how the system works throughout the company.  Most importantly, I want to answer any questions that people have about the PRC process.

Date:  Wednesday, August 8
Time:  2:00 p.m.
Place:  Mt. Hood
Subject:  PRC Process

Let me or Debra know if you have any questions.
Gentlemen,

Just a couple of things regarding Delano for Sunday and Monday:

For Sunday, 8/5:
Delano is prescheduled at 30mw, so they have 15mw available to sell, HE1-24, SP15.  Please try to sell them for above their variable costs of $40.  It should be pretty warm on Sunday, so you should be able to sell them for most of the peak hours.

For Monday, 8/6:
Delano wants to implement the buy-back strategy once again.  So please try to buy-back 15mw, HE7-10, SP15, for below their variable costs of $40.  When you contact the control room, please only speak in "hour ending."  They said that would clear up some recent confusion on their part.

Thanks guys,
StanAll,

Sorry guys, but I won't be able to make our first game unfortunately. I will
be
on vacation in sunny California. I will be back for the game the following
Sunday though. But kick some ass without me!!

I am very disappointed we didn't make it to D-1. But oh well, we'll just
have to
destroy every team by 10 goals to prove to those bastards they made a
mistake.

See y'all on the 16th.

Jay

Hi Green Roomers,

The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the GPSD website at
http://www.gpsdsoccer.com/
You will be surprised to learn, like I was, that we were not promoted to the
1st division.  It seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2nd even
though I registered for and said we would accept the promotion to 1st
division in order to be eligible for the championship.

Our first game is on Sunday Sept. 9th at Delta Park #8 (NE of Strasser) at
12:15.  All of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12:15 and will occur every Sunday between Sept 9th and November 18th with
the exception of Sunday October 21st when we have a bye.  We then will have
a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again.
Right?

Don't forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or are
new to the team.  You update or get a player card at the OASA league office
off of Highway 26 at the Sylvan exit.  They do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there.

Anyway that is enough from me.  See you soon out on the soccer pitch.

 Subject: America The Beautiful

In the wake of the election fiasco and the national tragedy of today, this
is worth reading. We still live
in  the greatest country in the world and sometimes we forget what we have
worked so hard for.   This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to A
remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the
most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out
of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in
billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these
countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the
United States.
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries
in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were
flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about  the decadent, warmongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the
erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.
Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing
Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10?
If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines except
Russia fly American Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on
the moon?
You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not
once, but several times - and safely home again.
You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store
window for everybody to look at.
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on
our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.
When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking
Down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned
them an old caboose. Both are still broke.
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced
to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even
during the San Francisco earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned
tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing
with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their
nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope
Canada
is not one of those."

	After we convene the Management Committee later this week, I will make a further announcement regarding the Executive Committee.Dear ST_SW Traders,

FYI - 
There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.

Just wanted to let you know and get your input.

El Paso lending is on for Friday and Saturday - see yesterday's e-mail. (I made one mistake. The second deal should be STSW, not STWBOM, buys EPE.) Following is a detail of the short positions we have for Sunday and Monday.

In the southwest:
STWBOM and STSW will each be 25 mw short on peak at PV for Monday at a price of $51.50. Proceed as usual, and fill shorts under the appropriate desk. Please see me if you have any questions about this procedure.

	737722 - STWBOM buys EPE
		 On Peak/PV
		 25 mw @ $51.50

	737758 - STSW buys EPE
		 On Peak/PV
	 	 25 mw @ $51.50

In the northwest:
We also have a lending agreement at Mid-C on Monday - STWBOM and STNW will each be 25 mw short off peak at Mid-C at a price of $34.50 (Sean's curve price minus PGE's $1.50 lending fee). Unlike with El Paso lending, we have not entered a place-holder purchase in the day-ahead market, so we'll be short in position manager 50 mw off peak at Mid-C. Please fill these shorts under the appropriate desk. 

In California:
Also, STWBOM is short at SP15 50 mw RTC Sunday, 50 mw off peak and 25 mw on peak Monday. Prices are $45.16 on peak and $35.79 off peak. Fill these short positions under the STWBOM book.

Let me know if you have questions.

I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts.  For the past 6 month, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower.  Accordingly, by the end of the day when I have to route, it has made my job that much easier.  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly.  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone's lives better!

Keep up the great work guys!!!!

To All,

I am sorry that this report is so late, the network link from Houston to the SF eMail server was down since sometime late Friday and this is the first time I've been able to connect since then.

Attached to this message is a summary of proceedings of the DSTAR Board meeting.  For those with little time to read the full text here are the highlights:

Board voted to make an Informational Filing of the TO Drafted documents
Continued funding of the DSTAR by the TOs, while it did pass, was tentative
DSTAR TOs are working on a for-profit Transco model governance

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind Regards,

Dave

 
Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

  Chris and Sue Calger are the prooud parents of a baby boy!  
Christopher was born July 11 and weighed in at 4 lb. 9 oz. 
 Both Mom and Baby are doing fine.
In the Southwest, EPE lending continues. STWBOM and STSW are each 25 mw short on peak at PV. Day-ahead price is $46. Enter deals to fill these shorts in the appropriate book. Reduce purchase prices in the following deals to $4. Sell back to EPE at $0.
Deals are:

	740196 - STWBOM buys EPE
	740230 - STSW buys EPE

In the Northwest, we've got a lending agreement going with PGE. STWBOM and STNW are each 25 mw short off peak at Mid-C. Day-ahead price is $27.25. We have not entered a placeholder purchase in the day-ahead market, so Real Time position manager will be 50 mw short off peak at Mid-C. Make purchases to fill this short. Under the appropriate desk, of course.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these agreements.

Thanks,
KateTwo things -

1. Weather Tracking - Did we decide to ask Fundamentals about tracking forecasted-to-actual temperatures? Or would you me to organize this specifically for Real Time?

2. BPA Transmission Losses - Would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis? For billing purposes and general clarity, I think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs (i.e. pay them back in an annuity each day, week, or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error).

Also, Darin Presto and Casey Anderson should both have 100% access to the systems they need; but it seems to be an ongoing process, so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

Let me know what your thoughts are on these two things.

Thanks,
Kate We would like to get together @ Amy's this Friday (8/3) around 7:00 pm for dinner and drinks to wish her farewell.

Subject: Final letter 


Greetings:

Here is the final letter we sent to DWR regarding the creditworthiness
issue.  It will be posted on our website at 2:00, just prior to our 2:30
press call.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Katie Kaplan
Manager of State Policy Affairs
Independent Energy Producers Association
(916) 448-9499After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re: unit outages.  We need to communicate with 2 different groups:  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk.  First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk.  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk.  That phone number is 916/351-2488.  When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned.

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.  Services will communicate outages to Real Time.

Thanks

Chris  Bill Williams in our real time group is going to handle this.  I believe he is in touch with Michael.

Thanks

 GENERATION AVAILABILITY DATA SYSTEM (GADS) TRAINING

In preparation for the implementation of the ISO Generation Maintenance
Program, California ISO has arranged with the Manager of NERC GADS to
conduct two training sessions on their Generation Availability Data System
reporting software and database.  Each session will take two days to
complete.  This training is free to representatives of Generation Asset
Owners.  Participants will be responsible for their own travel and living
expenses.  We have tentatively arranged for two sessions, one in the
Northern California Area, and one in Southern California, depending on the
number of seats requested.  The proposed dates are shown below.

This course is designed to familiarize those personnel who will be
responsible for reporting NERC GADS data for the Generating Asset Owner with
the software tools, data structure, and data rules.  It also provides
instruction on how to use the GADS database for running various performance
and statistical reports on your specific units or industry information.  A
detailed agenda is attached.

The exact location for the training will be firmed up at a later date.

California ISO needs to know the numbers of people the Generating Asset
Owners propose to send, in order to complete the planning.  To that end, we
are asking interested parties to respond by August 21, 2001, with the
following information:

Generating Asset Owner	Requested Seats in North	Requested Seats in
South

Response should be by e-mail to Dan Poole, dpoole@caiso.com
<mailto:dpoole@caiso.com>, with cc to Robert Kott, rkott@caiso.com
<mailto:rkott@caiso.com>.


Proposed Dates:

Northern California
Tuesday, September 18 and Wednesday, September 19


Southern California
Tuesday, September 25 and Wednesday, September 26

Subject: Rate for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System


Dear Customers-

Effective June 15, 2001, the Rocky Mountain Region (RMR) implemented Rate Schedule L-US1, for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services (copy of rate schedule attached).  This rate schedule was posted to RMR's OASIS website under 'Current Business Practices' on August 4, 2001.

During the month of July 2001, RMR began actively researching after-the-fact usage of RMR-managed transmission and identified some unauthorized use of transmission.  Some of you have been sent letters concerning perceived unauthorized usage in July.  you should receive those letters shortly.

RMR has discovered different causes of unauthorized use occurring within WACM and have attached a list outlining some of those causes.  This list is by no means a complete listing, but rather just what's been seen to date. 
A
 s RMR did not post this information publicly until August 4, 2001, we do not feel that we can charge customers for the instances discovered in July, but please be advised that from August 4th forward, this charge will apply.

Please do not hesitate to call me or Paul Humberson at (970) 461-7327 if you have questions or would like to discuss.  

Lynn Richardson
Public Utilities Specialist
RMR
(970) 461-7440Marketing personnel will again be taking call on weekends and holidays.
The 5808 extension will be forwarded to EPE's prescheduling personnel and
unit commitment plans will be developed over the weekend.

Please call me at 915-543-4335 or Pete Serrano at 915-543-2045 if questions
arise.

Please share this with other personnel as appropriate.
1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.

2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier.Bill,

These are currently being tested so all transactions will bridge into our downstream systems correctly.  I will let you know as soon as they are ready for use.

Arrangements have been made for a fun day out of the office on Friday, August 10, for the West Power Administrative staff as an appreciation for their hard work.  Kathy Axford, Jill Chatterton, Kathy Sheppard, Anna Mehrer, Erin Hall, and Emily Butler, and I will be out of the office starting at 11 a.m. for the rest of the day.  Sarah Clark and Sandy Ragnetti will be covering the administrative duties (answering phones, UPS preparation, copying, etc.) for the department.

Please see us before 11 a.m. on Friday if you will need administrative support with your projects, and contact Sarah or Sandy on Friday afternoon if you need administrative support.  Mollie has agreed to be available for extraordinary requests if they come up during our absence.  Thanks for your patience during our absence.  Contact me if you have any questions.

FYI--On Friday the Admin group will be lunching at Newport Bay Restaurant and then taking a two-hour Willamette Jetboat ride in the afternoon.  The weather will be perfect for it!
In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

We're trying to get a call in to FERC.  I am comfortable telling you to use the FERC's higher number until directed otherwise by FERC but I give relatively good odds that FERC will cave on this. I am not a lawyer, but when they cave, I doubt they can do it retroactively.

Steve Hall, any thoughts?

I just received this from our client rep detailing their position.
As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net.  
I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary.  If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order, we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC (or you) recommends it.

Thanks,

Bill, the $108.08 price you see in Footnote #3 of the e-mail titled CAISO
Notice: Correction of FERC June 19 Order Market Notice is the highest hourly
ex-post price during the last Stage 1.  The $91.87 price is 85% of $108.08
per the FERC Order.

The last Stage 1 occurred on Trade Date 5/31/01, HE 10 and 11.  A Stage 2
was in effect from 1132 - 2215.  See
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/08/8a/09003a6080088aa7.xls , 2001
Emergency Detail tab.

The Hourly Ex Post Price can be found in OASIS under Button 29, Ex Post
Market Information on the CAISO Website. The Order indicates that the price
should not include a Stage 2 and 3 and even though the cancellation notice
of the Stage 1was not until HE23 we are going by the strict definition of
when the Stage 1 was actually implemented.  Hope this helps.

Kate Dear all,

Regarding the email I sent below, for deal #442038 and #442872, they were originally entered in Oct, 2000 for ST-Whourly book to receive annuity amount of $53,518.94 from Saguaro and $172,518.16 from Las Vegas Cogen respectively. However, they were supposed to be for ST-Wserv to receive those money because at that time, ST-WServ book was not set up yet. These amounts had already gone through to ST-Whouly book in 11/30/00 P&L as PMA. In Jun 2001, the deals were changed to ST-WServ book but they were not actually picked up by settlement and Risk (as the deals have already liquidated, i.e., strip dates are passed). In order to reflect the change in desk, we need to put in two annuities today:

#683673 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $53,518.94

#683684 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $172,518.16

These amounts will be showing up in 7/12 P&L as New Deals for a total of $226,037.10 (inflow to St-WServ and outflow to St-Whourly).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

[I have sent out this email earlier but I needed to revise it so I recalled it. For those of you who received the earlier version, please just discard it.]

Hi Godfrey,

I would like to summarize our discussion on those deals we have had questions about (as described in the previous emails), in terms of when and how they will be come through or corrected in the coming future. Please review and let me know if they are not correct:

1. #442038 - the change in the annuity amount of $4,706.28 (from $53,518.94 to $48,812.66) will be coming through in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July) as an outflow to ST-WServ book. 
Chris and Les - I will put in a new annuity deal for the amount of $53,518.94 for St-WServ book sell to St-Whourly to reflect the change in desk (from St-Whourly to St-WServ) of the deal; the desk change made on 4/17 was not picked up by settlement as they were not informed. With the adjustment, the net effect of $48,812.66 will be given back to WServ.

2. #584331 - it will come through in June desk analysis

3. #600480 & #595779 - since these are interdesk deals, we will take care of it by entering two new annuity deals today (#680210 & #680220). They were not picked up by settlement as PMA when they were entered on 5/2 & 4/29 because they were interdesk deals.

4. #598971(leg 1-5) - they will show up in July desk analysis (= PMA at the end of August)

5. #442872 - the change in the annuity amount of $126,542.87 (from $172,518.16 to $45,975.29) will be coming through in Jun desk analysis as an outflow to ST-WServ book.
Again, the change in desk (from St-Whouly to St-WServ) will then be reflected by a new annutiy deal for $172,518.16 with ST-WServ sell to ST-Whouly.

6. #666350 & #666351 - they will show up in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July)

Please feel free to correct or add anything to the above information.

Thanks,
Samantha
503.464.7248We regret to announce that Amy Fitzpatrick will be leaving Enron's Portland office in September.  Amy's husband, Simon, has accepted a job in New Jersey, and it didn't make sense for them to "commute" coast to coast.  Amy will continue to work here for the next month or two to hire her replacement and to make sure that her responsibilities have been completely handed over.  We really appreciate having such long lead time to effectuate this transition.

Amy has made tremendous contributions to our office over the last 14 months.  We really appreciate her efforts.  We realize that Amy has become integral to the efficient operation of the Portland office and want to make her transition as smooth as possible.  If you have any concerns or wish to get any issues on to the "transition list" please let your manager and/or Amy know.

Tim Belden and Chris CalgerGuys,

Just wanted to let you know that you will see a new load zone within SDG1, called "Pilot."  This counterparty, Pilot Power, is an ESP (Energy Service Provider), much like EES, and we are their new SC.  So don't freak out when you see it in Caps.

Thanks,
Stan
The outage will continue through the weekend for the 17.91 MW on the steam turbine.  I filed an outage report with the ISO for this period although the ISO has not returned it.

Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBGN_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitted an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UNITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,

  Per an inquiry from Lousiana Pacific regarding deal # 421598.1 (LT NW):

  Structure: 		7 MW around the clock, 100% load factor. Buy back at basis or remarket at a 70% / 30% split.
  
  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
  February 24, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 1 - 24.   Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the "buy-back" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

 Bill:

Just wanted to let you know that Geir and I sold the Frontier Unit for the 12th.  We sold 8 MW due to the fact that the services book said it was available to sell Real Time.  However around 3:10 in the morning BPA called and gave us a tag number to look at and it showed the unit sold day ahead.  Just thought you might like a heads up on this issue because you will probably hear about it from Les or someone else.

Call me if you have any issues.

BertI have obtained a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below.  It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday.  Summarizing, the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC, which plan should:

prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan

adopt market mechanisms (rather than imposing rigid price controls) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs

promote conservation and demand response 

Please see details below.




June 12, 2001
The Honorable Curt H

?bert, Jr.
Chairman
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, NE
Washington DC, 20426

Dear Chairman H?bert:

Since last summer, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely
monitored the electricity situation in California.  Today, the West
continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century, and
California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again
this summer.  After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West,
including several hearings in Washington and California, we recommend that
the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity
prices and keep power flowing into California.

We recognize the Commission's efforts in recent months to address the
electricity crisis in the California and western markets, including measures
to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices.  While we are
pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout
the West, we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale
electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the
entire West in the hot summer months to come.  To ensure that prices are
just and reasonable during the critical months ahead, we believe the
Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices
in western markets.  We strongly urge the Commission to implement a
comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor
wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market
participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).

Specifically, such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale
electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the
WSCC.  The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and
failures to comply with agreements to sell power.  If the Commission finds
that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan, it
should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the
full extent allowed by law.

Aware of the danger of discouraging supply, the Commission has relied upon
market-oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would
exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts.  We share
the Commission's concerns regarding the need to encourage supply.
Accordingly, to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long-term solution,
the Commission's comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as
appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging
availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission.

To mitigate prices and increase available supply, we also urge the
Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote
conservation and demand response throughout the western market.  In States
where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs, consumers have less
incentive to conserve.  While demand reduction incentives are not a
substitute for accurate price signals, a demand response program can
encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity.
Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both
wholesale and retail consumers to sell, at market or other incentive prices,
"foregone" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume.
Specifically, the Commission should: (1) establish or certify a wholesale
"clearinghouse" for demand reduction agreements; and (2) enable consumers,
whether individually or through aggregation arrangements, to sell foregone
power to their own local distribution utility or to third-party purchasers.
We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand
reduction programs, but a broader, regional solution is needed to enable
sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer.  We
understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State
laws, abrogating existing contracts, or shifting costs to non-participant
consumers.

We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commission's previous
efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for
consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter.  To ensure
maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead, we request that you
take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as
possible.  We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not
later than the close of business on Friday, June 22.  If you have questions
please contact our staff.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation with
this request.

An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext.

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes.

If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters, forward it to Mike Hicks (Michael.Hicks@enron.com).  Corporate Security maintains a file on them, and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees.

For more information on these letters, please email or call Mike at (713) 853-6198.I have had to change 4 deals that were entered incorrectly.  Just  a reminder.


Make sure you put Tacoma in as City of Tacoma, Dept.of Pub Utilities

NOT  Tacoma Supp.

Thanks for looking into this, and for your quick response.

The traders names are: Darin Presto; John C. Anderson; Michael Mier. Of course, their need for a Lotus Notes account is implicit in this request. Beyond that, they need the following:

Title - WSCC Outages

There are two databases which I cannot locate:

West Realtime
WSCC Outages


However, I did locate:

Real Time Operations:  ECTPDX-LN1/ECT\realtime\myaccoun.nsf (Would this be the correct database?)
Realtime:  ECTHOU-LN7/ECT\mail\realtime.nsf


For WSCC Outages and West Realtime databases, if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following:

Close the database icon
Right-click on the database icon
Choose File, Database, Properties
Then send me the Title, Server, and Filename information.  This will be of great help.


Many Thanks and Please Advise.

My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching (currently a biology teacher at Richland High School) into something where performance is rewarded.

He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive.  Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys?   I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry.

I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle, so I'm not sure if you need people or not.  Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume.

Hope everything is going well for you and your family.

Good Morning,

If you are changing any deals that are currently flowing, please notify prescheduling of the change and deal number.  Small changes can cost us hours of work trying to find a change in balance.

The Preschedulers have a distribution list  DL-Portland Prescheduling.


If you have any questions, please see me.

CaraFYI -

We will NOT be confirming hourly trades for generators or any other counterparties until further notice. The logistics of the process are still being worked out. In the meantime, keep checking "No Confirm" on all deals.

Bloomberg deals are another story. They do get confirmed everyday. However, the people in the Confirms group know this inherently and do not need the added validation of a "Yes Confirm" checkmark. What they do need is a clue as to which deals have been done with Bloomberg, and the best way to convey this is by typing "Bloomberg" next to the word "Broker" in your Deal Entry screen.

If this is unclear, please let me know.

 All,


The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

LesSI is back up in FolsomBill, on Saturday night I handled a cut on a schedule that we bought from calpine @ Mead and sold to Valley.  We were informed of the cut after the hour was over and the subsequent hours were resupplied by Calpine.  Natalie at Calpine agreed to be charged LD's for the 1/2 hour that the power did not flow and we agreed to an integrated number of 13MW that did flow however, I told her we would get back to them Monday for the exact charges.  I did this due to the fact that we sold this power to one of our service customers and I felt we may want to discuss with them first before charging the LD's on this transaction.   Please advise on how to proceed on cuts like this.  Our sale to VEA was at $153 and our buy from Calpine @ $107.  I have entered cut notes with specifics in Lotus notes.  I will be in on Tuesday however, it might be best to resolve this issue Monday.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.Bill -

Arthur Anderson is an outside consulting firm hired by Enron to keep us on the 'straight and narrow' they audit many of our risk functions and other information as double check that what we say is happening is really happening.

I have been told by people higher up in risk to NEVER question Arthur Anderson.  BUT,  I would encourage you to E-mail Tim Belden or Stacey White and ask them these same questions.  You need to be as comfortable as possible.

Cara -
When you get a moment, could you tell me what this Power Audit is for? Does Arthur Andersen work for us? That was my impression, but Bill asked and it occurred to me that I might want to know exactly who Tatiana is and why she wants this information before I start handing it out.

Let me know what you know.

Tatiana,

I have looked up all 5 of these deals in the system, and need to refer you to the following people for follow up
Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
      Deal # 566541.1

These deals are all West Hourly deals, and can be researched by Kate Symes, our real time coordinator.

Deal # 514141.2
      Deal # 536771.2

These need to be handled by someone onthe East desk,  514141 is a Long Term New England book deal, the other is an East Desk real time deal.  

I am sorry I cannot be of direct help on these, I have data for West Desk deals, but only Term and Cash. Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Cara,

We are in the process of auditing Power Trading for ENA and were referred
to you by Corry Bentley in regards of support for the West deals that we
selected for testing. Due to the fact that there are no executed contracts
for these deals, to complete our testing we need to receive 3rd party
support (NERC Tag or 3rd party invoice) for the following West deals:

Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
Deal # 566541.1
Deal # 514141.2
Deal # 536771.2

We are in the final stage or our audit, so your quick response would be
greatly appreciated.

Please call me at (713) 646-6335 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Tatiana

Folks,

I think you already know who I am, but just in case, let me introduce myself.  I work in the Houston office in Government Affairs.  I primarily work on larger-scale regulatory issues, such as NERC Policy and FERC Order 889.  Some of my main focuses are NERC Policies 3 and 9, the East's IDC tool, E-Tag, and OASIS.

I am fairly involved with the ESC (Electronic Scheduling Collaborative) and OSC (OASIS Standards Collaborative), and based on some discussions with several folks, thought it might be a good idea to come to Portland and spend some time with you. The goals of this trip are threefold:

1.) Make physical contact with folks in the West, developing relationships
2.) Discuss current events in the regulatory arena with regard to E-Tag, OASIS, and the ESC
3.) Observe a "day in the life of" a WSCC real-time trader and a scheduler

To this end, I will be visiting Portland next week.  I will arrive Monday night, and plan on leaving Thursday afternoon.  Given this, I would like to coordinate when would be the best times to get together with you and your groups.  

Alan Comnes has suggested that we address item 2 on the afternoon of the 19th.  That should leave all day on the 18th and the mornings of the 19th and 20th for us to meet and work together.  Do you folks have any preference as to when you would like me to "sit in" and if you would like to have any specific group or one-on-one discussions?  Please let me know, as I am flexible and really looking to learn how I can best support your goals in my Government Affairs activities.

I look forward to meeting you all in person and spending time with you.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Chip,

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?  All your help is appreciated.

Thanks,

http://phonecard.yahoo.com/As you should now be aware the preschedulers were unable to get all of their tags in by the tagging deadline on Friday.  Cara has left a color coded sheet of delayed tags that the real time group must implement between 4 hours  and 1 hour prior to the power flowing.  Please take a look at this sheet when coming in on shift.  Also, there are two tags that need special attention tomorrow (7/2) evening.  Tag numbers 25843 and 25870 have been printed out and attached to Cara's list.  These two tags were flowing through the CISO and needed to be checked out day ahead by PacifiCorp and the ISO.  Unfortunately the ISO and PAC needed real tags not delayed tags in order to allow PACs schedule to flow.  Therefore per my discussion with Dick Dowdy at PAC, he has created a tag showing the total of 35 MW coming out of his system (tag # 9152Y) in order to check out with the ISO.  
THE REAL TIME GROUP MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ON THE PAC TAGS: 1. send the delayed tags out prior to the times indicated on Cara's sheet but no sooner than 4 hrs prior to energy flow.  2.  On the pacificorp tags referenced above, please call PAC after sending the delayed tags and tell them to kill their tag number 9152Y.      3. Call the ISO to inform them of the tag change and give them the delayed tag numbers.  4.  call PSCO and inform them you have submitted the tags.  

Please make sure this is happens !    If this is not taken care of the schedule won't flow and  Enron will be charged liquidated damages by PacifiCorp.  If you have ANY questions regarding these tags or any other tags on Cara's list, do not hesitate to contact Cara, Bill, or myself on this matter.

 - winmail.dat FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a transmission capacity bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we will need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee or buy transmission  with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.to fill the lending short. Note: EPE will still deliver us energy at PV. Then enter a zero priced buy-resale in Enpower to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Kate

 Question -

I'm trying to determine the nature of charges incurred by the Real Time desk for 8/2. The inter-zonal scheduling charge (522) assessed to ECTRT for the day totals $781 for 3,500 MWH flowed into and out of California. This results in a charge of $4.48 per MWH. The information Donna compiled on charge 522 has the rate at $.223. Is there an element of this charge I'm not aware of? I'd appreciate any further information you guys can provide.

Thanks for your help.

Kate 	In light of today's events, The Travel Agency in the Park will remain open 24 hours with a dedicated emergency staff.  If you need travel assistance, please call 713 650-8080 or 800 962-0248.The first sentence bothers me. I've never lent anything from anyone in my life. Are all of the traders familiar with "lending agreements"? Is this enough explanation to avoid confusion on Monday?

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Thanks,
BillGroup,

Due to the recent drop in day-ahead prices, we have a few counterparties who scheduled less than their P-max generation.  Therefore, we need to submit supplemental bids so they will be covered in case the ISO calls on their generation (for the difference between the P-max and their prescheduled generation).

Additionally, if you can make an SC to SC trade with this generation please do.  If you are able to do an SC trade, please make sure it's for at least a 4 hour run.  Make sure you're in contact with the control rooms to let them know what you're doing.  And if you do make an SC to SC trade, don't forget to take out the supplemental bids for those hours.

So, please submit supplemental bids, or sell as an SC to SC trade for Harbor, Delano, Wheelabrator Martel, and Sierra Pacific Industries.

Harbor:
Supps:		80mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $140.
SC Trade:	80mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $125.

Delano:
Supps:		15mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $40.
SC Trade:	15mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:
Supps:		6mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $60.
SC Trade:	6mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Industries:
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	30mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.


If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,

 Hi Green Roomers,

The Fall Outdoor Soccer Season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the GPSD website at
http://www.gpsdsoccer.com/
You will be surprised to learn, like I was, that we were not promoted to the
1st division.  It seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2nd even
though I registered for and said we would accept the promotion to 1st
division in order to be eligible for the championship.    

Our first game is on Sunday Sept. 9th at Delta Park #8 (NE of Strasser) at
12:15.  All of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12:15 and will occur every Sunday between Sept 9th and November 18th with
the exception of Sunday October 21st when we have a bye.  We then will have
a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again.
Right?

Don't forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday or are
new to the team.  You update or get a player card at the OASA league office
off of Highway 26 at the Sylvan exit.  They do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there.

Anyway that is enough from me.  See you soon out on the soccer pitch.

 Group,

Delano is back from a unit outage, and all day (Monday, 8/20) we have been selling 25mw for them.  Bert has already sold them through HE22.  Guys on the night shift, please sell only 10mw for HE23-24.  They will produce a total of 45mw through HE22, then drop to 30mw HE23-24.  They were prescheduled at 20mw all day long.  They are back to their normal preschedule for Tuesday, 8/21 (45mw peak, and 30mw off-peak), so no real-time action is required for Tuesday. 

Thanks for your help.
StanYou have probably seen the notice already.  I expect some sort of industry response.

Subject: FW: CAISO Notice - New Requirements Regarding Scheduling And
Dispatch Instructions
Importance: High


Greetings:

The ISO just released new requirements for scheduling and dispatch
instructions for generators. I have attached these requirements for your
convenience.

They claim that they had put these requirements in place, which are in
effect immediately, because people were continually out of compliance with
their (and FERC's) orders.  All of the requirements are extremely
concerning- and we should discuss further.  One note of interest (but not
surprise) is that the ISO is inflicting these requirements (such as failure
to submit feasible schedules) on the generators only, claiming their actions
are causing grid instability, when in fact failure of the load to properly
schedule and procure for their customers is of graver concern.

Other requirements will cause the units to be run harder that needed,
further jeopardizing reliability and supporting our arguments made in the
protest.

If you think we should discuss further please e-mail me and I will set up a
call.

Sam -

We're once again in need of a new trader ID - Todd Bland joined the Portland Real Time group as a summer intern, and it seems he hasn't been added yet. Could we get his name added as a trader for the following desks:

Short Term West Hourly
Short Term West BOM
Short Term Southwest
Short Term California

I appreciate your help with this. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate I'm working with IT to get an EES mailing list set up so we can send the Real Time sheets to them each night with only the click of a button. In the meantime, they'll need you to click just a few more and send the sheet to.....

This is only temporary. Don't worry.

Thanks,

Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead.

For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked "Confirmation" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking "No" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED.

Change is inevitable (especially at Enron)!  Although the announcement of Jeff Skilling's resignation is a surprise and generally sad news, it is important to remember that our business here in Portland will not be affected by Jeff's departure.  Likewise, the leadership of Enron Americas and the broader Enron Wholesale Services management team remains unchanged by this announcement.  In summary, business as usual!

For those of you that were not on this weekend I would like to inform you of a new possibility for sales. Transalta buys at both SP 15 and Mead 230 in both cases they plan to export to Lugo/Victorville. Since they ask to buy this power transmission contingent we can wheel through the ISO from PV to Lugo (ISO ID LUGO_5_VICTVL). They will pay a premium to get the power at lugo and they will buy the power transmission contingent. Have fun with it.

Hello hello!

I was so worried that I had said something in my last E-mail to make you say
"Whoah!!! What was Brendan thinking?"  So when Brendan came in as my patient
for a follow-up, I told him "Nope your friend didn't E-mail me...Nope I
haven't heard from him."  I actually was sort of embarrassed.  I told
Brendan, "I worked like 92 hours that week and was E-mailing people to stay
awake.  He may have been one of those early morning E-mail's.  I don't
remember saying anything too bad???"  But hey I was working a ton!  People
get a little odd!

He's like "Well why didn't you E-mail me to tell me that?  Bill is just like
that sometimes.  I'll give him a call about it."  Actually I didn't plan on
hearing from you, but I'm gald I did.  There's only one slight
problem...because I didn't hear from you, the only day I have free and it's
actually a night is July 3rd after like 3pm then I leave back to NM at 5:54
AM on the fourth.  Now you may already have plans for this night if so no
worries.

I need to find a hotel close to the airport for that night with a shuttle
service.  If you know of any that would be a great help!  After our first
E-mail experience I'm assuming it might be easier to call you than to E-mail
you.  So...I will talk to you soon unless you E-mail me first.

I actually just got home from CAlifornia and am absolutely exhausted!  So I
will write more or call you later on this week!  I also apoligize for not
having a spell check on my E-mail.  My fingers sometimes get away from me
and I don't always proof read!

I will be in touch soon! :)

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.Green Roomies,

thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,

                                My Best, CraigFired Calif DWR Traders Had Access To ISO's Control Room  Updated: Tuesday, August 21, 2001 05:34 PM ET 
By Bryan Lee 
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Four of the five California Department of Water Resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operator's control room. 
That revelation was contained in a recent letter to the House Government Reform Committee from Terry Winter, the California Independent System Operator's president and chief executive. 
The letter responded to House lawmakers' concerns, voiced during an Aug. 2 hearing, about DWR power traders having access to the ISO's control room floor and the wealth of market-sensitive information available there. 
Rep. Doug Ose, R-Calif., who chairs the committee's energy policy panel, said access to the ISO's control room allowed DWR traders to "cherrypick" power purchases, and led federal regulators to exclude DWR purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order. 
The five fired DWR traders owned stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN </investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news </investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), a major power provider in California. 
The four fired DWR employees with access to the ISO control room were William Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Chung. The fifth, Richard Ferreiro, wasn't among those Winter listed as having control-room access. Neither did Elaine Griffin, who resigned after it was learned she owned Calpine stock. 
They were among 14 DWR employees who had their control-room access privileges terminated by the ISO over the past two months. The others had their badges deactivated because they either hadn't filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadn't been using their badges to access the ISO control room, said Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman. 
Nine DWR power traders still enjoy access to the ISO control room, according to Winter's letter to Ose. Among them is Bernard Barretto, who reportedly owns stock in Enron Corp. (ENE </investments/quotes/?symbol=ENE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=ENE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=ENE>). 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis who recently sold Calpine stock after conflict-of-interest concerns were raised, said earlier this month that Barretto's investment met state ethics rules because Enron wasn't making sales in the spot market, where the DWR employee was involved in making power purchases. 
DWR employees' investments are "thoroughly reviewed" to make sure there are no conflicts, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said. Employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests, Hidalgo said. 
An Ose spokesman, Yier Shi, said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of California consumers. 
"It's pretty obvious that it isn't in the interest of California consumers, the DWR or the ISO to have that conflict of interest in the power-purchasing process," Shi said. 
"Why is DWR getting preferential access? That's the core issue," Shi added. 
Allowing DWR power traders into the ISO control room is "a real conflict because DWR is the major buyer in the state," said Lynne Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Association, whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in California. 
"Having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorter-term markets are charging, (including) what's being sold and to whom," Church said. 
"Any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access," she said, noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access. "It's just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence." 
During the Aug. 2 hearing that Ose chaired, Winter agreed that having DWR employees in the control room was a problem. The ISO is "working very hard to get them out," he said. 
The access was provided back in January, after the DWR was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about $10 billion in power on behalf of the state's bankrupt and near-bankrupt investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG </investments/quotes/?symbol=PCG>, news </investments/news/?symbol=PCG>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=PCG>) and Southern California Edison Co. (EIX </investments/quotes/?symbol=EIX>, news </investments/news/?symbol=EIX>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=EIX>). 
Power providers were balking at continuing to sell power to California unless they were assured of creditworthy buyers. And the DWR refused to take on the responsibility unless the ISO granted the agency access to the control room, Winter told Ose's subcommittee. 
The arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts, he said. 
The DWR will withdraw its employees from the ISO control room effective Sept. 1, Pete Garris, who oversees power purchases for the DWR, announced over the weekend. 
"It wasn't our intent to be there on a permanent basis," said Hidalgo, the DWR spokesman, who described the privilege as "a temporary move to keep the lights on." 
Now that the state's electricity crisis has lessened, the DWR's "goal" is to have the traders out of the ISO control room by Sept. 1, Hidalgo said. 
"We're pleased to see that the DWR is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the ISO," said Shi, the Ose aide. "We hope this change of policy isn't too little too late for California consumers to win refunds."

In the meantime, if you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to see Amy or Grace.
Bill & Chris,

Guys please make sure to stay in touch with Jim Reyes on a daily basis to ensure that we are keeping a net payable position with the ISO for the month.   Between these congestion relief efforts and EES A/S self procurements efforts We don't want to end up in a net receivable position at the end of the month.  At this point I think that we are underestimating expenses.  I'm not sure how much.  I'm sure based on the amount of load and an average cost per MWH we can determine what our average expense position should be and that should be the room we have to play with each day / month.

I'm not saying stop your efforts, I'm just saying we need to stay on top of the overall Net cumulative position for the month.

If you have any questions please let myself or Scott Gilbert know.

Thanks - MO

	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or
e-mail me.

Kate - I need to provide Kathy more info. on the buy/resale deals that we have in EnPower for June, but not on the model.  This is the invoice I am sending her ( attached below ).  She needs to know who it was bought from, rate, and if there is a service fee.

I gave her all the info. I see - but that doesn't seem to help her.  Can you help me find what she needs.  

Also, on these buy/resale deals.  I need to know at the first of the month that these deals are there.  Otherwise, Kathy never has them in her checkouts with me; thus I see them as something we have in EnPower, not in the model, and not in El Paso's numbers.  I then research them and put them in DMS.  Then later find out they needed to be checked out on and included in our invoice.  These deals are too after the fact; so we need some system that yall let me know they are there.

Thanks

Here's a quick description of the database:

"WELCOME to the "Pool Information Guide" and thank you for taking the time to register!  Please click "ADD RECORD" to fill in the template with your information.

This on-line database was designed to help all of us stay in touch this summer at Enron and beyond (and to save us from having to keep forwarding and updating spreadsheets).  Feel free to update your record and/or download the database as often as you like.  Please encourage your peers to register with the site so that we may all benefit from having one central reference point.

You can use this site to locate someone's desk, to find out who is working on projects of interest to you, to get the word out about your interests beyond your assigned project, to round up folks to discover Houston with, to see who is celebrating a birthday, or to plan a carpool or shared commute to the office.

You will notice that there are several required fields - these fields will be used by HR for their "book."  All Summer Associates & Analysts will receive a copy of this book, which will also contain our pictures.

Enjoy!

Donald I, too, am for moving up.  Also, I play pick-up with a group of people,
three or four of whom could really help us heighten the level of play, if I
can recruit them.

As for practices, Justin Kerr and coach the varsity boys at Oregon Episcopal
School off SW Scolls Ferry Rd.  Our fall practices run until 5:15 PM, after
which the Green Room may be able use the fields.  Justin is chummy with the
Athletic Director, so we'll see what we can do (they're pretty nice fields).

IN OTHER NEWS, I am in the process of moving.  This weekend I found a
beautiful 4BR, 3BA house in the SW hills on a big chunk of land.  It's got a
garage, terraced lawn, wood floors, etc.  However, I don't have three
roommates.  If anyone on the team or their friends is looking for a place,
let me know if they might be interested in pursuing this house (It's
$500/month +util. +dep. for each of the four people).

Good morning 
 
Just wanted to give you a heads up that WTC voicemail was down for a short time this morning.  The link between WTC and the Qwest CO was down.  The link was reset and it seems to be back-up and working.
 
What happens when the link goes down:
 
1) The message waiting light won't go off after you retrieve your messages. If this occurs just have the person lift the handset, hear dial tone and dial,  113. This will clear the message waiting light.
 
2) The message waiting light is not on and you could have a message.    Have employees check their mailbox just in case they are expecting critical messages.  The next voicemail will activate the message waiting light.   
 
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.

El Paso Electric is "lending" power to us on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to borrow from their system.   The sale to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed from $56 to $4 on Monday).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We hope to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (Do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion.)

Chaos,Inexperience Hobbled Power Buyers
State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders.
By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L. RABIN
Times Staff Writers

August 12 2001

It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis, when California's first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka.

Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening, trying to figure how to keep the lights on, when a speeding tractor-trailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train.

"I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising," said Ray Hart, head of the energy planning team. The symbolism was not lost on him.

The next day, with the state's electricity supply on the line and the governor's political career on the blink, Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West, purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke.

Now, seven months and billions of dollars later, the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry. Even Gov. Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch.

"It's like the Yankees playing a stickball team," he said in a recent interview. "We're totally out of our league."

The administration's new long-term contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future.

Making matters worse, nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companies--a fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements. Five were hastily fired, and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations.

"How an agency could forget conflict-of-interest codes, or ignore them, is beyond me," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "This is the way people lose faith in government."

Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in, including one from Davis' Republican political rival, Secretary of State Bill Jones.

Amid all the controversy of recent days, Hart said, the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed.

"Frankly," said Hart, a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources, "it's kind of disconcerting we aren't getting the credit we should be getting."

Patching Together a Team on the Fly

The state's new energy-buying organization was a beg, borrow and recruit operation. A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project.

The agency received an immediate infusion of $22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants.

On the fly, Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers, workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and the energy industry.

Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices. Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand.

From the start, the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms.

"Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day," a state budget document said. "It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively. Professionals in this business are highly compensated."

Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February.

"They said, 'Can you be up here Tuesday?' " said Mead, a 55-year-old former Edison engineer from Duarte. "I said, 'For a job interview?' And they said, 'No, bring enough stuff for several months.' "

They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume, Mead said. He worked six weeks, he said, before he finally got a contract to sign.

"In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage 2, on the verge of blackouts," he said. "There was no focus other than to keep the lights on." One day, Mead said, he bought 10% of all power consumed on the state's electricity grid during his 12-hour shift.

But, unlike Mead, most of the new crew had never bought power before, according to their resumes. Most worked at the now-defunct California Power Exchange, an energy trading floor similar to a stock market, reconciling sales and purchases made by others. Before that, one worked at a freight-forwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia.

Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group.

"They're just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast," said Mark Palmer, spokesman for Houston-based Enron Corp., one of the nation's largest energy marketers. "It's like someone who flies a kite one day, and then is told to go fly a 747 the next."

One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings. "You don't just come out to someone and say, 'What's your price?' and then pay it. But that's what some of them have done."

A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said, "The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them."

Palmer said California, for the salaries it's paying, could have done better.

A particular lightning rod for criticism is the $480,000, two-year contract of chief trader Susan T. Lee, 30, who was hired in April for $120 an hour.

With barely a year's experience in the energy industry, she leads a 16-person crew that buys electricity the day before it's needed or for nearly immediate use. State records show that Lee was paid more than $30,000 a month, including overtime, as she began her new duties.

"That lady's got one year's experience, and she's getting 500 grand," Palmer said. An experienced trader in private industry, he said, might make $80,000 to $120,000 in a good year, plus bonuses.

"She's certainly making double what I am, but she's worth it," said Hart, who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the once-obscure Department of Water Resources.

Although Lee could not be reached for comment, Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of today's evolving trading market. California energy deregulation began only in 1996, and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year, he said. "I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody [regardless of experience]."

Lee's team members, meanwhile, have been signed to lucrative short-term contracts worth a maximum of $15,000 to $21,000 a month, including housing, rental cars, per diem pay and flights home on days off. State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount.

One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange. He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didn't think they were qualified.

Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete.

"They know more than me; they've seen it all," said state trader Bernard Barretto, a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 1998.

In their own defense, the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost.

"Our job was to buy whatever we could buy," former trader Elaine Griffin said. "California was truly a captive market."

Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higher-ups.

"Do the [traders] go out and start the deal? Yes," Hart said. "Do they cut the final deal? No."

Far from the trading trenches, the governor sees things differently. The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources, he said.

"These are very sophisticated operations," Davis said. "They have several meteorologists and banks of media people."

To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of California's power-buying binge, state officials turned to a technique called "sleeving." They used Lee's old Long Beach firm, Mieco Inc., and Allegheny Power to camouflage the state's identity as the buyer.

The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills.

Some traders, however, saw through the guise. The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tip-off that California had weighed in.

"I knew it, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it, too," said one trader, who like others, asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state. "But it worked for a while. It helped keep the short-term prices down."

Controversy Over Stock Holdings

The state traders were powerless, however, to protect themselves.

Just as they were settling into their new jobs, and energy prices were falling, the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks. The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired.

Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firm--San Jose-based Calpine Corp.--in which they had owned stock.

The highest-ranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira, who was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to negotiate long-term power contracts.

The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers: Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng. Elaine Griffin, who had resigned just days before the firings, also held Calpine stock while trading for the state.

Most of the traders, who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra, said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem. They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares.

Mead said traders on his state team--such as Cheng, Leung and Louie--had no ability to influence Calpine's stock price because their purchases of the company's electricity were infrequent and small.

Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because he'd made so much money on it. He said his investments of $20,000 in 1999 and $134,000 last fall brought him about $400,000 when he was ordered to sell last month.

"You want to know how I picked Calpine?" he said. "Investor's Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks, and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential."

Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his $2,000 worth of shares on Jan. 22, while still at the Power Exchange, which had a conflict-of-interest policy barring ownership of energy stock.

"I didn't know I would have an opportunity like this at the time," Leung said of his briefly held state job. "I bought it just because I'm interested in the market all the time. I follow it."

Today, shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento, the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis' effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis.

They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings.

"The big boys, the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose, those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention," Mead said. "They're the ones who knew how things worked."

I still have not confirmed anything with the old Biddy's team so I suggest
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as I do.
Check out the scrimmage Keith found at the Washington Park soccer field on
Sunday at 11.  He says its open and ok for us to take part. The field is
close to but South of the Rose Garden, Trolley Station and closest too but
down hill from the kids playground.  To get there from the Rose Garden take
the Road to the left which brings you back into SW Portland.  Hope to see
you there.

Subject: RE: Practice Sunday at 1 


Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

"Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week."

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line. 

Jon

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

I've just spent an hour on the phone with IT in Houston regarding the e-mail I sent out this morning (re: John Anderson's application access). Both Leola and Shari at the IT Central desk (wherever e-mails go when you send them from the e-request website) confirmed that they were able to login as John Casey Anderson and, more importantly, were able to login to Enpower. Interestingly enough, Casey has yet to avail himself of the wonders of the Enpower application here in Portland. I have also tried logging on as janders3, and I do in fact see a link to Enpower in the Start menu under Business Applications; however, it tells me this link has been moved or removed.  

Shari told me there was nothing more she could do for me if I'm not seeing the same links that she is; so at this point I'm going to call on your expertise one more time, and hope that we can solve this together.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,
KateAll,
    
We have seen some symptoms of problems with the voicemail system.
 
The Problem:
The Message Waiting Indicator (MWT) on the Meridian phones is not lighting for several hours after new messages are received.
 
What we are doing about it:
I have contacted PGE Telephone Services and they have opened a trouble ticket to have the problem looked into.
 
The workaround:
If you are expecting messages or if you have not checked your messages in a while because you have not seen the MWT light, please proactively check your voicemail box by dialing x7600, hit the # key for you mailbox, and enter your password.
 
I will send out an update message when I have more news.

Subject:	MPC March 2001

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

  VirginiaTAG 99S WAS CUT TO 0 FOR HE 09.  I PURCHASED POWER FROM SRP TO RESUPPLY THE POWER AND WILL SHOW A SELL TO MIRANT 50MW @ $32 SINKING WITH PNM.   THE DEAL NUMBERS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE AND SALE ARE 771251 AND 771253I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts.  For the past 6 month, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower.  Accordingly, by the end of the day when I have to route, it has made my job that much easier.  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly.  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone's lives better!

Keep up the great work guys!!!!

Thanks,
KateReal Time Traders,

Willamette has sold 15 Mw on peak FIRM to the LTNW desk. This schedule is tagged and scheduled by the Northwest desk. Should there be an outage resupply the schedule at Mid-C and enter a deal showing a sale to Willamette and a buy from the resupply source. 

Services will also be selling 3 Mw of unit contingent energy from Willamette on going. If there is an outage on this schedule cut the schedule and call Pac transmission to take the schedule to zero.

Let me know if there are questions.

LesI'm there.

Adam

Short-History
In case you haven't heard, our project to implement a high-bandwidth connection between Houston & Portland and remove our dependence on Terminal Server is a failure.  To make a long story short, the new DS3 allowed more data to travel back and forth but the time to get data between Houston and Portland was 10 times slower than running it through terminal server. 

Plan B (Thin-Client)
So where do we go from here.  We are now starting a process to re-architect our trading applications so that they will run just as fast over our WAN as they do through terminal server.  We will be using an architecture that minimizes the traffic over the WAN, utilizes specialized servers to do most of the processing, and implementing more back-end power.  To help us in the effort, we need your help to identify which applications should be converted first.

Good Candidates for Conversion
Listed below are some attributes for applications well suited for the initial architecture conversion.
1.  Runs flaky in Terminal Server (Access Violation errors, application locks-up, etc)
2.  Applications primary source of data is located in Houston 
3.  Mission Critical time constrained applications
4.  Mission Critical poor performing applications
5.  Heavily utilized applications

Feedback from you
Please reply back to the email or stop-by if you have any thoughts on which applications you think should be converted in the first-wave. 

Poston's list 
I've been hanging around for over a year and I think I have a pretty good idea of what might be some good applications for conversion.  Here's my first cut.
1.  Enpower Deal Scheduling
2.  Enpower Deal Entry
3.  Enpower Real Time Position Manager
4.  Enpower/FSP Schedule Blotter
5.  New Auto-Routing Application
6.  CARP report
7.  SAR report
8.  Forward obligations report


Thanks,  David Poston

Amy$6.9 million profit from the West is not much to show for all of the sleeving Sempra did for the ISO.

Sempra's trading unit generates a windfall
 
By Craig D. Rose 
STAFF WRITER 
July 27, 2001 

Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. 
On the other hand, Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. 
The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. 
The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. 
Stephen Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. 
California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels. 
Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. 
The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. 
SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. 
In a media conference last month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. 
Shames says the proposal, which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. 
He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer "makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers." 
Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. 
A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. 
Sempra Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. 
California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. 
Though Sempra earned money on trading, its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. 
Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. 
Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating facilities it expects to build. 
Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, which lowered profits. 
Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. 
"They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses," said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. 
Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. "We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this," Leedom said. 
Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange.

All

We had 2 service outages today, the External Internet and Email both became unavailable at about 11:00 am today, service was restored in after about 15-20 minutes.  The fact that both services went down at the same time is only coincidence.

Below are the basic causes for the outages:

The Internet outage was caused by an error in one of our Network Routers.  The device was rebooted and service was restored.

The Email outage was caused by a bug in Exchange that is remedied by rebooting the server.

Sorry for the inconvenience these outages may have caused.

In past years, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) has
evaluated its operating practices through an independent review.
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) plans to commence the ISO's 2001 Operational
Study during September 2001. As in past years, the Operational Study will be
focused on hour-ahead, day-ahead and real-time operating practices performed
by ISO personnel in its Folsom and Alhambra control rooms. 
PwC is seeking input from ISO market participants prior to conducting its
Operational Study. Consistent with prior studies, the scope of the 2001
Operational Study will not include active settlement disputes which are
being addressed in other forums. 
If you would like to meet with PwC (via conference call) to discuss the
scope of this Operational Study, please call Ms. Ericia Berti at (916)
351-4453 or e-mail her at eberti@caiso.com <mailto:eberti@caiso.com> .  You
can schedule a meeting for Wednesday, September 5th or  Friday, September
7th.  Market participants will be given the opportunity to have a member of
ISO Operations management, Vicken Kasarjian, present during all or a portion
of their meetings if they so desire.  Information conveyed by market
participants to PwC during these meetings will be treated in the strictest
confidence at the request of the market participants.
When scheduling a meeting, please advise Ms. Berti whether you prefer to:
1.	Meet with PwC only;
2.	Meet with PwC and Vicken Kasarjian; or
3.	Meet first with PwC only, followed by a session including Vicken

I told her I had no idea how it happened.   I just wanted you to know.
I basically told her I found the hole and I called on my own.  The maintenance people have her number on file 
or something, so she was looking around for the original person that called.  

Sorry.  Thought I could keep it a secret.  You can't keep anything from her it seems.

JillCara - Bill (III) and I know of an individual that is looking for a career change. He is currently available - has a degree in engineering and Masters in Business.  I can expect he would be interested in the position - sort of like Bill originally - does not have trading experience, but is a fast learner and would be a good addition I believe to the team.

I do not know the salary range for this position - but would expect it to be near entry level.  This may be a bit of a nip to John (Adams) - but as both Bill and I have been talking to him about for a year or so now - Enron is a great place to work, training is top shelf - we have good people, and need more good people to keep our edge.  Who knows what his career could go to in a few years. John has extensive background in pulp and paper, and could end up in that trading floor someday.

John is a Graduate of the Naval Academy - former A-6 pilot, a great golfer, and all the rest, and more importantly - has a very good work ethic.

Let me know what you think

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers

changes in its Settlement System to support the following:

*	Credit Risk Adder; and
*	Emissions & Start-Up Cost Recovery.

Credit Risk Adder
The FERC Order put in place a price mitigation scheme for the energy markets
in the western United States.  It also directed ISO to add 10% to Market
Clearing Prices (MCPs)paid to generators for all prospective sales in its
market to reflect credit uncertainty.  The Credit Risk Adder is only used
for settlement purposes.  The ISO Scheduling System will continue to
determine MCPs using existing algorithms and the MCPs published in ISO's
OASIS will also reflect the unadjusted MCPs.  During the settlement
calculations, ISO will increase the following MCPs by 10%:
*	Dayahead and Hourahead MCPs for Ancillary Services (A/S); and
*	MCP for Real Time incremental energy.

The adder raises the MCPs, but does not affect the underlying settlement
formulation.  The only change made to the Settlement Files is the inclusion
of a new data field for the unadjusted MCP.

Emissions and Start-Up Cost Recovery
The FERC Order also directed ISO to exclude emissions and start-up fuel
costs from the calculation of ISO's mitigated Market Clearing Prices.
Generators can invoice ISO for such costs incurred as a direct result of ISO
dispatch actions.  ISO will implement two new charges:
*	Charge Type 591 - Emissions Cost Recovery; and
*	Charge Type 592 - Start-Up Cost Recovery.

These new charges serve as a mechanism for ISO to collect funds which will
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators' invoices.  A rate will be
established by ISO for each charge.  For Emissions Cost Recovery, the rate
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs,
incurred by Must-offer Generators as a direct result of ISO dispatch
instructions, adjusted for interest as may accrue in the Emissions Cost
Trust Account, divided by the sum of the forecasted in-state load served by
the ISO's transmission system.  For Start-Up Cost Recovery, the rate will be
determined similarly.  It will equal that of the forecasted annual total of
all start-up costs, incurred by Must-offer Generators as a direct result of
ISO dispatch instructions, adjusted for interest as may accrue in the
Start-Up Cost Trust Account, divided by the sum of the forecasted in-state
load served by the ISO's transmission system.  ISO plans to publish these
rates shortly.  The rates may be adjusted monthly based on ISO's latest
forecast.

Both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the Scheduling
Coordinator's Settlement Statement for the last day of the trade month.
Detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the Scheduling Coordinator on a
given day will be provided in the statement for that day.  

Implementation Timeline
The Credit Risk Adder and the new Emission & Start-Up Cost Recovery scheme
went into effect on trade date 6/21/2001.  The statements for 6/21 will be
issued on 8/15/2001.

Client Relations Communication
CRCommunications@caiso.comGreen Roomers:

What better way to start off this Division 1 season than with a party at my house in the Southwest Hills?  Below, you will find the invite.  Guests are of course welcome, too (particularly guests of the female persuasion - most of my invitees are guys, so I'm counting on them to bring the girls with them).

Hope to see you all there.

Hello all,

Considering the circumstances if we don't move up, I think we should just
move
up to the first division. As a lover of european soccer, I enjoy the
promotion/relegation system. It is a great way for leagues to equalize
competition. So we should just take it in the gut and toughin' up and move
to
the 1st. It'll be fun and competitive. Maybe it'll give us more motivation
to
stay focused as a team. I'm all for it. Afterall, we deserve it. We earned
this
move. I don't want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to stay in
2nd
Div.

But this does mean that it wouldn't hurt to have a few more good players
join
us. So if you know of anyone really good, have him join.

Jon--The check's in the mail.

To the first!

Jay

Hi Guys,

Just a quick reminder that I do need to get a $50 from all of you who want
to play on the Green Room's Fall '01 Soccer Team.     The money ($670 2nd
Division or $760 for 1st Division) is due to the league by July 23rd so I
need  you to send me a check ASAP.  My address is 8573 SW Dakota Drive
Tualatin, OR 97062. The 10 games will be on Sundays from 12 -2 mostly some
2-4 games starting on September 9th.

The other issue I need you to ponder is 1st Division vs 2nd Division.  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in 2nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship (for 2 years) if we are 1st or 2nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to 1st division.  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager (nay volunteers?) and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out 1st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better.   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in 2nd or move up to 1st.  Also send me
money!  Thanks.

503-691-8067.We are 25 mws long HE 7-22 at palo verde in the real-time position manager.  I printed a forward obligation report for the 20th and that report does not reflect this length.  After checking every deal at PV for the 20th against the forward obligation report it appears that our deals have been entered correctly.   I discussed this with Holden and he agrees there is no reason we should be long at PV for that day.  Therefore, the correct position at PV for the 20th is flat.  The length is false.  If you are aware of any deals that may have caused the real-time position manager to reflect this length, please let me know.

stacy.runswick@enron.com	This is a reminder that the Summer 2001 ISO Demand Relief Program
charges are reflected on the June 30 statements and June invoices.  As
announced previously this year, the ISO has developed a Summer 2001 Demand
Relief Program (DRP).   The program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the ISO system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 Emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a Stage 3 Emergency.  

	Similar to last years program, the same charge types are utilized
for capacity, Charge Type 7 and 117, described in the first link below.  Two
new Charge Types, 3472 and 3482,  have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail, described
in the second link below.  Although the program was initiated in June, no
calls were made to curtail load, therefore, charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized.    The periods in which the Demand Relief Program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below.

 - C.DTF Blackouts don't justify takeout, Connell says 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 25, 2001) 
While operating in "crisis" mode, Department of Water Resources staff worked 20-hour days, slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep California's lights on. 
Saying the department "charged enough to feed a small army," state Controller Kathleen Connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about $3,600 for department food purchases in January. 
"We are not going to be paying these bills," Connell told reporters Tuesday. 
The state does not buy business-hour meals for staff while they are in town, Connell said. Additionally, the use of a government-issued credit card to make the purchases was improper, she said. If the department does not require the employees to pay for the takeout meals, she said, the department will have to absorb the cost. 
The Department of Water Resources began scrambling to buy power Jan. 17 after Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency -- the same day Northern California was hit with rolling power blackouts. As a result of the department's new responsibility, staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock, said Oscar Hidalgo, a department spokesman. 
Buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm, Hidalgo said. 
"Under emergencies such as these ... we believe we were in a position to do this. Our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood," Hidalgo said. 
California's recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forget the level of crisis the state was in, Hidalgo said. "It seems at every turn ... people are making Monday morning quarterback calls," he said. 
Connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze. 
They said using the "Cal-Card" for buying food is specifically prohibited. "It's not an open line of credit," she said.

	Ose puts the blame where it belongs by pointing out that the ISO's favoritism towards DWR cost California billions in potential refunds.


ISO's role in sales is rapped: Critics challenge the independence of the power grid operator.
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published Aug. 3, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- The independence of California's power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state Department of Water Resources came under fire at a House of Representatives hearing Thursday. 
But grid operators said there was no way that arms-length transactions with the Department of Water Resources could have been negotiated beginning in January when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money. 
Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, chairman of the House Governmental Affairs energy policy panel, charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the DWR and the California Independent System Operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators. 
"The state's interference into Cal-ISO has possibly cost Californians billions of dollars in potential refunds," Ose said. "Moreover, it represents a serious violation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations." 
At issue is the fact that the ISO is run by a five-person board appointed by the governor when, under federal law, it is supposed to be independent. Additionally, the ISO's biggest customer is the DWR, which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cash-starved to buy it themselves. 
Last week, the FERC determined that the DWR would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts. In reaching that decision, the commission cited the agency's special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers. 
Terry M. Winter, ISO president and chief executive officer, said that at the time the Department of Water Resources began buying power in January under these unusual circumstances, there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses. 
"That occurred because the market was not functioning," Winter said. "They were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power." 
But Kevin Madden, the regulatory commission's top lawyer, said the relationship between the ISO and the Department of Water Resources raises troubling questions. 
"DWR buying on behalf of the state is a market participant," he said. "It shouldn't be in the ISO control room. It shouldn't be allowed to cherry pick" among power sellers. 
Madden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the ISO should be reconstituted to ensure its independence.

Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) and PGE Park are proud to announce "Party at PGE Park," a fundraiser, celebrating the opening of PGE Park. PFE has been very fortunate to have an outpouring of support from our community. They want to acknowledge the community's enthusiastic response to PGE Park by giving back to those organizations that make a difference for Oregon.  So, they are hosting Party at PGE Park.

Party at PGE Park is a fundraiser and 100% of the proceeds of our party will be distributed to three prominent local non-profit organizations:

			*	Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism (SOLV)
			*	The Portland Oregon Sports Authority Foundation
			*	Special Olympics Oregon

Delano will schedule into the Day Ahead market and make a sale at the PX index price.  Real Time submits dec bids in the Suplemental Energy Market for any hours when they believe there is a good chance of being dec'd at a 0 price (the pprice you bid may be different than 0 to establish ouselves in the ISO Merit order - ).  Real Time makes 50% of the difference between the day ahead PX and the dec price (in this case 0).

Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBGN_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitted an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UNITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,
StanTo whom it may concern:

I've requested Enpower access for one of our new Real Time traders - John C. Anderson - three times now. In addition, Chip Cox in the Portland IT department has attempted to gain him access to the necessary applications, to no avail. It is imperative that Casey Anderson receive access to Enpower in the very near future, as he is still unable to perform necessary functions of his job after having been here three weeks. 

Please let me know when I can expect these e-requests to be filled, as I have already received e-mails saying they have been granted. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject:	El Paso Units

Gentlemen,

After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,

  I have the following charges on BPA's revised final bills and was wondering if you could tell me who's books these should go on?


  October 2000	  $ 3,214
  February 2001   $ 4,153

  I spoke with Corrine Surface at BPA and learned that these charges are being applied given the following situation:

  On October 10, 2000 and February 1, 5, and 6, 2001, our Real-Time group called BPA to reserve transmission for some schedules.  Our R-T guys requested tranny using account numbers (such as 794811) that were for day-ahead firm transmission, thus entering the field of Unauthorized Increase Charges (incurred at $12,000/MWh) .  Since BPA did not go over the structure of the product in that account, they are not going to charge us the $12,000 per MWh, but since we did get firm transmission, we will have to pay the $59/Mwh for the firm; hence the above charges.

  I understand that you have also spoken with Corrine at BPA and were going to talk to Bill.  Can you let me know where these charges need to go? 

  (Bill - Diana is out this week, so if you have already talked to her about this, please let me know)

  Thanks,
  
  VirginiaThis is a semi co-ed scrimmage....last week about 4 girls showed up....so
feel free to invite females of the opposite sex.

Last week we had enough for almost two full teams.

Hi Guys,

I still have not confirmed anything with the old Biddy's team so I suggest
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as I do.
Check out the scrimmage Keith found at the Washington Park soccer field on
Sunday at 11.  He says its open and ok for us to take part. The field is
close to but South of the Rose Garden, Trolley Station and closest too but
down hill from the kids playground.  To get there from the Rose Garden take
the Road to the left which brings you back into SW Portland.  Hope to see
you there.

Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

"Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week."

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line.

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

Hi Kate,
Melissa Murphy just notified me that there will be a list of about 10 counterparties (we do not have the list yet) to whom we will need to start sending confirmation letters for hourly deals.  That is no problem at all, except that I just pulled up the first two (Chris Foster specifically wanted us to confirm these two today) and they have the wrong energy type.  They should be CAISO energy.  These are deals #640353, and #640338.
I know that the hourly traders are not in the habit of making sure that these energy types are correct, but if we are going to confirm these, they need to make an effort to do so.  Will you please forward this to them and make sure that all of them are aware how important this will be for documentation purposes?
Thanks so much!

Subject: CAEM Study: Gas Dereg Has Saved Consumers $600B 


 
FYI - The report is attached.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 14, 2001



CAEM Study: Gas Dereg Has Saved Consumers $600B 


Nearly 20 years of competition in the natural gas market has reduced national energy costs by more than $600 billion, according to a new study issued Monday. 

This amounts to per-household savings of $5,938 as a result of gas deregulation, which began in the late 1970s with the phased removal of wellhead price ceilings, then graduated to lighter-handed regulation of interstate pipelines and now is focusing on opening up the distribution end, according to the study commissioned by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM), a non-profit think-tank in Washington, DC. 

"The nearly 20 years of competition we've experienced in the natural gas industry proves that the right conditions can foster lower costs for consumers and motivate the industry to make investments that benefit the environment, our economy and our national security," said CAEM CEO Ken Malloy. 

In addition to the cost savings to the public, the study credits deregulation for the rise in the number of gas suppliers at the wholesale and retail levels; a reduction in long-term price fluctuations, although it has triggered more short-term price volatility; greater focus on energy-efficient purchases by customers, making gas the fuel of choice for many; and industry improvements in how its buys, sells and trades gas supplies. In addition, it noted that light-handed regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers. 

In short, the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the 1970s and early 1980s "were wrong by a long shot," according to CAEM. 

"What we also need to recognize is that we've witnessed a re-distribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers, and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our [national] security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil," said Malloy, who formerly was on the staff at FERC and the U.S. Energy Department. 

The study, entitled "California Here We Come: The Lessons Learned from Natural Gas Deregulation," offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state: 1) put the right regulatory framework in place, half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing; 2) don't expect results overnight, stay the course; 3) markets do work, and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform; 4) the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits; all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits; and 5) organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers. 

RT traders,

Due to a meeting I need help. I need real time to call into BPA Frontiers and Grays Harbors schedules. The tags have been issued and approved however the account numbers need to be called into BPA.

The tag for Grays is 26932 the tag for Frontier is 27806.

The account numbers for BPA are hilighted in the Services Book.

Call around 2200.

Call me if there are any questions.

Bill -

Come by and talk to me about an opportunity starting in october 1st.  Basically, Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin would like to outsource some real time transactions to us for a short period of time until they get comfortable with SLICE.  They will probably come in for a meeting on September 20th or 21st in the morning to discuss this.  I would like you to be there for the meeting.

StewartEveryone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.

If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal,

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

Chip,

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?  All your help is appreciated.

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out.  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this.

		Energy Exchange Program Neutrality Adjustment
		Charge Type 1487
		SC Settlement Contacts:

		Background
		As you may know, the Energy Exchange Program began on trade
date 11/14/2000.  In this program the ISO obtained needed energy in the real
time market and, rather than paying for the energy as a purchase, later
returned the energy in another period.  This was not necessarily a
one-for-one exchange.  The incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned, a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued.  Since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently, there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the ISO. The ISO created Charge Type 1487 for
the allocation of the cost to SCs participating in the market during the
incoming schedules

		Notification
		The ISO has created Charge Type 1487 so that whenever an
Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance, the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the SC's based on their total
negative Uninstructed Energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place.  This new Charge Type will appear beginning on the
June 30, 2001 statements which will be published on August 23, 2001.  In
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as December, 2000
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data.

		CT 1487 is a semi automated charge, meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated, but it will be a manual charge type
within the Manual Line Item Records and will not require a change to your
settlement system.  Note that this charge will not appear on every
statement, but only when an Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance.  


		If you have any questions, please contact your Client
Relations Account Manager.

 There will be no deals on the ST W Hourly books.
 ST NW will show only PGE purchase deal # 529161.1 (offset by SWAP between ST NW and LT NW).
 All other deals (421598.1, 530654.1, 530653.1, 530690.1, 530716.1, and 530689.1) have been changed to the LT NW book.

  Per an inquiry from Lousiana Pacific regarding deal # 421598.1 (LT NW):

  Structure: 		7 MW around the clock, 100% load factor. Buy back at basis or remarket at a 70% / 30% split.
  
  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
  February 24, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 1 - 24.   Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the "buy-back" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

With the new system, we need to rework the timelines of some jobs that pull data in.  The creation of Customer Finals must take place prior to our pulling in the schedules to create our estimates.  I am requesting that you implement a 3:00am deadline for Customer Finals to be created.  We will run our job at that time that pulls in schedules.  If the Customer Finals are not created by 3:00, then our job will be run again at 5:00am.  We understand that there are special circumstances that arise and we can deal with those on a case-by-case basis.  This is vital for us to have the finals created in this timeline and makes our lives much easier!

If you do not have any problems with this, please pass on this request to the rest of the RT team and implement this timeline on tonight's shift.  Otherwise, please discuss with me and we can work w/ Pete to square this away.

Per our discussion, I have taken out the three items you questioned about and added the additional items in my prior email (BPA etc) we agreed on.  I have attached the revised PMA file for your reference.  I'll continue to work with Settlments to find out what happened to the three questionable items and update you and Bill on that.  Other than that, the total PMA for WHOURLY taken today will be
 -$54,135,26.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

-FranAfter the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4300 MW to 4020 MW and in the (S-N) direction was
changed from 3675 MW to 2450 MW for HE's 1900 through 2400; and the PDCI

for the COI, line work; and for the PDCI, the Celilo Valve Group #1 was
forced out of service.  This applies to real time only.  The ISO will update
you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations,

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.  We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $68

Let me know if you have any questions.

According to this article, Morgan Stanley now controls about one-third of the Southern Intertie's total northbound capacity, or about 1,145 megawatts, until February 2002.  Then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until March 2003.---sch 


Wall Street joins the energy players 
By Les Blumenthal 
Bee Washington Bureau 
(Published June 9, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- Wall Street's interest in the West Coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some Manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for much-needed generating plants. 
Morgan Stanley, which earned more than $5.5 billion last year, has quietly purchased a major share of one of the Bonneville Power Administration's huge transmission lines that link California with the Pacific Northwest. 
The $18 million deal caught Bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Morgan Stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the so-called inter-tie to ship power purchased in the Southwest for sale to utilities in Washington state and Oregon. 
Although most of the attention in the Western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from Texas and other Southern states, Morgan Stanley ranks among the 15 largest power marketers in the nation, according to reports filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Morgan Stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in 1995, the first Wall Street firm to take such a step. 
Merrill Lynch also is registered with the commission. 
"Wall Street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities, including energy," said Judy Hitchen, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New York. 
But many in the utility industry said they hadn't realized Morgan Stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading. 
"I wasn't aware of it," Mark Crisson, superintendent of Tacoma Power, said of Morgan Stanley's purchase of capacity on the inter-tie. "It shows how things are changing." 
And in Congress, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Morgan Stanley's direct involvement in West Coast electricity markets wasn't all that surprising. 
"It's wonderfully lucrative for a few folks," DeFazio said. "This is the big new game. It's the new world of deregulated energy." 
Bonneville has four major transmission lines linking California and the Northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of Seattle. The lines were built by the federal government, are operated by the transmission arm of BPA and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that Bonneville could hog the region's power grid. 
Morgan Stanley now controls about one-third of the lines' total northbound capacity, or about 1,145 megawatts, until February 2002. 
Then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until March 2003. BPA and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity. 
"They sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date," said Shepard Buchanan, a spokesman for BPA's transmission side. "No one had ever made a long-term purchase of that (transmission) path before. It had never come up before." 
Under federal regulation, BPA had no choice but to accept the Morgan Stanley bid. 
The transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand. Though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit, theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market. 
Buchanan said Bonneville would be keeping a close watch on Morgan Stanley. 
"We are concerned," he said. "We don't want anyone gaming the market by controlling the (transmission) system. We will keep a close eye on Morgan Stanley and others." 
Although not a secret, the deal was finalized in early January and since then has been accompanied by little public notice. 
"We purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations," Hitchen said in response to written questions. 
Morgan Stanley's Internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing. 
"Commodity trading revenues rose 34 percent to a record level in fiscal 2000, primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energy-related products, including electricity, natural gas and crude oil," the company's annual report said. "Increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products, relatively low inventory and reduced production values." 
Morgan Stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market, saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the inter-tie it doesn't use to other power marketers, federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales. 
"We have also offered capacity for resale to third parties," Hitchen said. 
Others remain skeptical. 
Bonneville's power-marketing arm also has expressed unease with the Morgan Stanley contract. 
Bonneville sells about 45 percent of the wholesale electricity in the Northwest, most of it low-cost hydropower generated at the 29 federal dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers. It also controls about 75 percent of the region's electric transmission grid. 
Crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants. 
"It doesn't surprise me a lot that they are marketing power," he said. "They are capitalists. But they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities."

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

There is a chocolate almond roca with chocolate ganache cake up for all to share.
HI there stranger!

Well I haven't spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and I'm just
checkin' to see that my lil' buddy in Portland isn't working himself too
hard.  As you know I tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a
workout and a scrimmage soccer game.  I am so sore!  It's out of control!

Ok so down to the REAL reason I'm writing.  Brendan and I had a great time
at Happy Hour.  We talked a little about you but mostly about life in
general.  He had mentioned that he had E-mailed me so I rushed home to check
it.

Basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as
odd.  I guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt.
He had written that although you thought I was cool and whatever you had
commented on how "strange " the situation was and he sort of elaborated on
that.

So the point of this E-mail is I guess to reassure you that I only have the
best intentions towards you.  I am not trying to be your girlfriend or
anything similar to that.  To tell you the truth I don't even know what your
"romantic" situation is.  I just think you are an awesome guy whom I'd love
to become close friends with.

 I am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in Huntington Beach (if you
still are) and I'm thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together.  I
bragged and bragged to Brendan about what a great guy you were and then came
home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances.  I really am
just a very overly affectionate and loving person( not to mention
spontaneous).  I didn't mean to scare you away from having a great
friendship with me and me with you.

For heavens sake you are my Portland connection and I'm your beach bum
buddy.  Honestly if I were a psycho I would have jumped at the chance to
come up and see your condo when you offered.  I just think you are someone
I'd love to get to know.  Especially if you are anything like Brendan (which
best friends usually are) he is such a sweetie!  When he and Meg go to visit
her mom in LA they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are
welcome to stay with me as well.

I guess I never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to
be quite honest I didn't even think to ask Brendan because it's not
important.  I want you, Bill, for your friendship and for your companionship
now and when I move to Portland.  Reflecting back I realize that I may have
written or said something that caught you off guard.  It's just my
personality.  I'm a huge flirt.  For heavens sake I was voted "Most
flirtatious" my senior year not to mention "Most likely to succeed".
Probably the second one due to the first but who knows!  Hahaha!  I'm only
teasing.

Ok seriously now Bill, I want you to be honest.  If I did (locating your
condo etc.) or said (like that was the most romantic thing I had ever read
that was written by a guy) something to upset you or give you a false
impression I am so sorry. I do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived
in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter I knew
your "romantic" stiuation, yeah I would have jumped at the chance to have
dated you.  But we didn't and the truth is I can never have too many
friends.  Especially good looking ones that I can introduce to all my "girl"
friends so that they can be jealous with envy! :)

Like I said I only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our
relationship as friends.  But if you are uncomfortable with something I've
done or said I am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or E-mail
me and you'll never hear from me again.  Scouts honor!  I 've never been a
scout but I'm not know for my lies either. Teehee.

I would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our
realtionship as friends.  If I can I'll put your mind at ease if not well I
enjoyed our short 30 minute interlude.  As always you are still welcome to
come visit me and stay with me I would love to have the company.

If I don't hear form you within the next couple of weeks I'll assume the
worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you
change your mind.  I'm lucky in the fact that I can do that sort of thing!
:)  Ok just E-mail me or call me.  Let me know that you are alive and
kickin'.

 I'll be leaving for Calgary, Canada this Thursday morning at 6 am and will
be there until the 16th.  I'm so excited this is my first trip out of
country but then again you know that!  So I guess I'll hear from you when I
hear from you.

I just thought of a last possible reason... I may be way off base here but I
am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself.  He
is a real sweetheart and he's going to make a wonderful husband and
father... just not with me.  If you are concerned about our friendship and
him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and Todd is
secure enough in himself that he doesn't care.  If this is about August and
you staying with me, my father is moving me down not him and it will be a
long time until he can come to visit.  Also when I get there we are not
going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship.  I haven't dated
or had much of a wild stage and I have told him that we will see other
people.  He's fine with that as well.

Ok I admit that his Potland stunt was a little irrational but hey I thought
it was thoughtful and darling.  I love surprises and little "extras".  I
just didn't expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy
to someone whom I'd never met.  Therefore I did everything in my power to
rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this.
You think I'm a psycho!  Not to mention I had to face Brendan and before he
could read my E-mail you had already revealed the stroy to him!!  SO I got
to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience!

Ok that's it.  take it however you will but it's 12:51am and I'm exhausted!
I did the best I could to figure out and fix a possibly non-existing
problem.  I hope I did well enough to inspire a response from you.  :)  Hope
to hear or read from you soon!

Goodnight and God Bless,

Nikki

							Lisa - 
I'm trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at Kyrene for the 31st of May didn't make it into the preschedule sheet. I'm looking for the following deals:

627022 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH - 2 MW @ $0
	 comments: Losses at Kyrene

627025 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH - 76 MW @ $170
	 comments: Delivery at Kyrene

These deals are pulling into the CARP report, but are not shown in either the preschedule or Real Time El Paso models. Therefore, Enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model. Can you give me a hint on this one?

Mark -

The ad hoc team's product is attached.  It is a suggested revision to the
NERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are:

*	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The
table provides rules for e-tag software to automatically set the flag.

*	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e.,
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval
entities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags,
etc.).  But, a financial mechanism would likely have to go through a
cumbersome review/approval process which would be too inflexible for the
fast paced world of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the
suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved
the closer the submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we
considered three parameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and
the default composite status.

	*	The assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag
Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag.
Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the
final composite status.

	*	Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite
status does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if
appropriate.

	*	The default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to Denied.

	For real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where
Purchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.

	*	Tags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred
to 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to
deferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite
status of Late).

*	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistant time zone standard.  The
team was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to
include in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on
the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times
on the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion.

*	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agent's time clock - it should stay with the authority service.

*	Here's a big one - because the timing table allows for later
submittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the
hour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the
feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to 10 minute duration stranddling the hour (i.e., starts
at 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would aglign the WSCC with the
Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals.

IWe are 50 MW short at the Mid-Columbia during the offpeak hours for Monday (HE 01 thru HE 06, HE 23-24).  We are short to Portland General.  When you buy, put 25 MW in the Short-Term Northwest Book, and put the other 25 in the West Hourly BOM book.

EPE lending has us short 50 mw on peak at Palo Verde - 25 mw under STWBOM and 25 mw under STSW. Purchase to cover the short and sell back to El Paso at $0. Reduce prices in the following day-ahead purchases to $2.

751968 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $44.25

751977 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $44.25

In California....

STWBOM will be short 50 mw on peak at SP15 (STCA is also short 13 mw, same time, same place). Day-ahead price is $42.28.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
KateBill - does this sound reasonable? Do you have anything to add?


Please make a note of the following. I know we have several new traders, and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process. But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job. Thanks.

1. Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book. Pay attention when extending deals. If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book, you don't have energy to sell from that book.

2. Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso.

3. El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done. Check spreadsheet formulas. 

4. El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model (m://electric/epe/epe01/aug01/epe reconciliation model) and all variances explained.

5. Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $15 FLAT broker fee per trade. If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades, enter a per-megawatt fee, and extend the deal later with bilateral trades, you're effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL. Can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn't simply multiply $15 times the number of Bloomberg trades done? Please let me know.

6. Most importantly, if you are unsure, call someone who is.

Thanks again for your attention to these matters.

KateI'm just sittin back here (WAY BACK HERE) trying to watch the X games on the TV up front. My workout was very very good.  I've been running and/or weigh training at lunch for the past month. I feel so much better when I workout. It's helped me deal with my work issues. Anyhow, yes I did get invited to that candlelight party thing. First of all, I don't even know who Erin Hall is. Secondly, I have no idea what a candlelight party is, but it sounds lame. 2 in the afternoon? Candlelight? What is that all about? So, I'll talk to ya later gator.

BWe have received the executed EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 8/13/01 from the referenced CP.  A copy will be scanned into Livelink.Group,

The plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for Saturday, 6/9.  The plan is as follows:

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called.  This is due to the ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes.  We don't want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

So, please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade.  Below is their preschedule, mw's available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID's.  Also, attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone #'s.  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.  

Harbor:		HARBGN_7_UNITS
Supps:		80mw available, HE1-24, Saturday, for $140.
SC Trade:	80mw available, SP15, Saturday, above $125.

Delano:	PANDOL_6_UNITS
Supps:		15mw available, 30mw prescheduled, total output equals 45, HE1-24, Saturday, for $40.
SC Trade:	15mw available, 30mw prescheduled, total output equals 45, SP15, Saturday, above $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:	MARTEL_2_AMFOR
Supps:		6mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 13, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $60.
SC Trade:	6mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 13, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Holding:		We don't know their unit ID because we're not their SC
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	15mw available, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,
Stan

 As of today, the marketing personnel will no longer be on call on the
weekends.  The 5808 extension will be forwarded to Enron along with the
5872 extension.  There will be no preschedules or unit commitment plans
developed over the weekend.  Such preschedules and unit commitment plans
will be generated on Friday or the day before the holiday until further
notice.

Please call me at 915-543-4335 or Pete Serrano at 915-543-2045 if questions
arise.

Please share this with other personnel as appropriate.I fixed it, no idea where those megawiggles went

Subject:	PGE Park Suite Talk - First Right of Refusal


One of the benefits of our suite at PGE Park is that we have the first right of refusal on non-Portland Family Entertainment events such as PSU Football games and the City JazzFest concert.  ENA will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public.  Non-Portland Family Entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for Enron employees, and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties.  

If you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the PSU Football games or City JazzFest, please notify me via e-mail by 2 pm Pacific Time, Friday, June 8.  These tickets are to be purchased by the employee. The entire suite must be purchased by Enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets.  Twenty-two tickets per event are available:  18 are seats and stools, 4 are standing room.

?	The price for City JazzFest (Sunday, July 15) is $916 for 22 tickets = about $42 per ticket.  

?	The price for all 6 PSU Vikings games (22 tickets each) is $1,404:  about $11 per game, per person, and all 6 games must be purchased.

We will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Anna

Description of City JazzFest:  This full day music fest will feature Jeff Lorber, Spyro Gyra, Marc Antoine and the headlining package, Dave Koz & Friends including Michael McDonald, Brian Culbertson and Norman Brown. The show is produced by House Of Blues Concerts.  An intimate concert setting has been developed at PGE Park that will feel like a small amphitheatre, but with all the new amenities PGE Park has to offer.Group,

As a general rule, we are not submitting supplemental bids for our generators unless there is a Stage 1 emergency.  We wanted to lay out a plan of action in case the ISO dispatches one of the generators during non-business hours (i.e.... when the Services Desk is not in the office.  And I know what you're thinking Leaf, this does not mean between the hours of 9am and 4pm :)

We have two rules of thumb to follow:  (1) if the ISO dispatches Harbor Cogen  (2) if the ISO dispatches any of our other generators.

(1)  If the ISO dispatches Harbor, please decline the ADS instruction.  The reason for the decline is they are off-line and are having start-up issues.  Then, immediately call one of the members of the Services Desk.  The order to call would be Stan, Chris, then Les.  Either one of us will then discuss with you what should be done next.  The most probable scenario would call for you to put in Supplemental Energy Bids in for Harbor equal to their costs.

(2)  If the ISO dispatches any of our other generators (Arco, Delano, Sierra Power, Wheelabrator), please decline the ADS instruction.  The reason for the decline is they are off-line and are having start-up issues.  Once again, immediately call either myself, Chris, or Les to discuss what should be done next.

Thanks,
Stan
Bill,
	I didn't enter the annuity for the Aquilla deal as I have a couple more questions on the matter.  I'd like to detail the deal in case you have any questions.

	Sold 50mw to PWRX @ $60 HE 15-18 (SP15)
	Covered with EES length and Wheel-Martel length to leave net short position of 42, 38, 35 and 32 respectively
	As the deal clearly turned sour and lowest offer in the 70's, I opted to take the short to the imbalance and hedge the price risk
	
	HE 15 bought 42mw from Aquilla at a fixed price of $55 and sold 42mw vs the "expost settlement price"
	HE 16 bought 38mw from Aquilla at a fixed price of $55 and sold 38mw vs the "expost settlement price"

	I found a decent offer for HE 17 & 18 ($63 Reliant) so I didn't hedge

	Expost settled just above $90 for both hours and Jason will be in on Monday to confirm these prices with me

	*I spoke with Coral about financial deals as well but Travis didn't seem to understand which side of the deal he was on as he lowered his fixed offer as a counter.

I'll be in Monday to enter the annuity and confirm the price

CraigPlease make plans to attend a West Power Trading luncheon staff meeting.  Chris Stokley and Jeff Richter, please feel free to attend if you are in Portland.

Traders-

  After speaking with Risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done, I have made the following changes that will affect your books:

 There will be no deals on the ST W Hourly books.
 ST NW will show only PGE purchase deal # 529161.1 (offset by SWAP between ST NW and LT NW).
 All other deals (421598.1, 530654.1, 530653.1, 530690.1, 530716.1, and 530689.1) have been changed to the LT NW book.

I hope this will make things easier.

 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP).

There is never time to do it right, but there is always time to do it over.IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September
5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty,
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule, information that is relevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of "ISO
Debtors" against "ISO Creditors" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further,
while the ISO may be asked by an "ISO Debtor" to assert such claims in the
PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.
Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty,
are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the
claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX

MARKET NOTICE

For hour ending 0100 on June 21, 2001, the California ISO will implement the
following terms and provisions pursuant  to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") June 19, 2001 Order concerning market mitigation
measures for California and the Western System Coordinating Council.

FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DECLARES A SYSTEM EMERGENCY:

*	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy 10-minute and Hourly Ex Post
prices shall be set in accordance with FERC's April 26 Order, as clarified
by FERC's June 19 Order.
*	The Market Clearing Price ("MCP") for Ancillary Services shall not
exceed the Hourly Ex Post Price for the same hour in accordance with FERC's
May 25, 2001 Order, as described in the CAISO Emergency Notice-May 25, 2001
FERC Order On Implementation of the Price Mitigation Plan in April 26 Order.

*
*	FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DOES NOT DECLARE A SYSTEM EMERGENCY:
*
*	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy MCP shall be no greater than 85
percent of the highest Hourly market clearing price established when the
last Stage 1 emergency was in effect.

*
*	APPLICABLE TO ALL HOURS:
*
*	The system-wide gas price utilized to calculate the Proxy Price

To all -

I just received a call from Thresa Allen in Houston regarding a Louisiana-Pacific sale made by Long Term Northwest. The deal flows 2000 through 2006, and the dispute falls on 2/23 and 2/24 of this year. The 7 mw round-the-clock sale was reduced to 4 mw for HE 11-24 on 2/23 and HE 1-24 on 2/24. Louisiana is disputing this, saying we should have booked out with them for these hours. (Diana entered deals to bookout with Louisiana for 2/25-2/28 - 530268, 530334, 531224, 531549, 532573.) Thresa believes we need to enter a 3 mw purchase to complete the bookout for 2/23-2/24. 

I wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me. (Bill entered a purchase annuity from L-Pac - 531549 - for a ramp down.) 

Please let me know if any of this sounds familiar. Thresa said this dispute was filed back in June, so she's eager to get it resolved.

Thanks for your help,
Kate
hey, i am back in olympia now.  my friends wedding was sunday and i drove
home last night.  too bad i didn't have the better e-mail address.  the
wedding was really good, i tend to get cynical about such things but found
myself enjoying it and even tearing up at times.  i saw a lot of people i
haven't seen since high school which was mostly good. it doesn't seem like
that much changes, a bit of growing up but people are still the same.
jennifer was one of the other bridesmaids, do you remember her?  i used to
call her niffer. anyways, seeing her was especially good.
are you still enginering??? (smiles)  when you get a chance, let me know how
you are.

AmyI agree with Jerry's proposal.  However, I would like to add one more
thing...
Change the "PSE Submit Deadline" for a real-time tag to 20 minutes (instead
of 30 min).  We are insinuating that already, when we say the "Provider
Assessment Time" is less-than or equal to 10 minutes and the "Time to Start
of Transaction" is greater than or equal to 20 minutes.

Subject: FW: Possible new E-tag time table


Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.

 - Jerry's Proposal.doc 
 - Mons' Proposal.doc To whom it may concern,

just wanted to let you know that colstrip units 1 thru 4 tripped off line @ approximately 2:45.  The integrated number that PGE gave me was a 19MW, so I purchased a tranny wheel for 13MW from BPA (Portland General to MPC).  Furthermore, for HE 04 thru HE 07 the schedules went to zero and I resupplied from PGE and bought a tranny wheel from BPA (same as above).  The new deals in enpower are 764045,764203, and 764168.  If you have any questions I have put a cut note by Kate Symes in the accordian file and put cut notes in lotus under the respective counter parties (ExpressPIP, Holnam, Luzenac, Louisiana Pacific, and Ashgrove).  If there are any questions please give me a call.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.


  Bill and Kate:

Attached please find the prior month adjustment items we got from Settlements for WHOURLY book.  The total P&L impact is 
-$82,555.76.  Please note that this is still preliminary and please review and verify them (* I will do the same).  I am sending them to you just to give you a heads up.

In some of the items Settlements didn't put the deal number under explanation.  I have sent out an email to them so we can know what those adjustments are for.  At this time of the month Settlements are usually overwhelmed by questions and requests so they might not get back to us before Risk needs to finalize the dpr on next Tuesday morning for 8/31.  If you feel uncomfortable taking any one of the items in your 8/31's P&L due to unclear explanation or other reasons, please let me know.

CRCommunications@caiso.comFYI -

I've created a spreadsheet that will track APS line losses our group has incurred and paid back. This will allow us to see at a glance the month's transmission purchases and what it's cost us to purchase power in order to pay APS back physically. Keep in mind that loss volumes are calculated as 2.5% of the total volume of transmission purchased in a given period. 

I will maintain this spreadsheet, and you're encouraged to reference it at your leisure. Please let me know if you have questions.

Kysa/Kate

I have compiled a spreadsheet with the Bloomberg hourly deals I still haven't received a deal number for from July.  Please see the attached.  The 1st column are the Enron deals #'s I THINK Bloomberg should be added to.  If those are correct please change accordingly and add fee.  If not please research.

Thanks

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become "The World's Leading Company," and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, "Lay It on the Line" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming "The World's Leading Company."

We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001.

To access the survey, click on or copy the following URL onto the Enron intranet site: <http://etcsurvey.corp.enron.com/wi/p0731404/i.asp>.  If this link does not work, go to home.enron.com under "New & Notable" and click on "Lay It On the Line."  If you have problems with the survey, contact the HRGIM Help Desk at 713-853-5666.

ChrisGood Afternoon,

With the go-live date for FSP/VMS still in question, we have decided that we will build interim solution for CAPS.  There will be a new button added to the main menu of caps called "Upload RT EOL".  This new function will prompt the user to input a date & an hour.  The new function will then select west-hourly, EOL, SC trades from Enpower for the date & hour selected & insert the rows in CAPS.

Please let me know immediately if anyone has any concerns or questions, we are starting on this work ASAP.

Thanks,  Poston
In addition to the people you're already sending the EES sheet to, please copy Bill and myself when you send this out each day.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Is this the right idea?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee to fill the lending short, then enter a zero priced buy-resale to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty X at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Subject:	West Hourly EOL Trades - NO CONFIRM
Importance:	High

To all -

As you may already know, the Short Term West Hourly desk began trading the Enron Online hourly market on Monday. These deals should be treated just like all Short Term West Hourly deals - they do not need to be confirmed. Unfortunately, it seems the EOL application created for us is defaulting to "Yes-Confirm," and West Hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters. 

I've spoken with the EOL help desk about changing this default setting, and they've informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change. In the meantime, I wanted to make you aware of these deals' existence. You will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the Short Term West Hourly desk in the future, and many of these will be made on EOL. Again, these should be treated as with any other West Hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this. I'll let you know as soon as I've heard more conclusive information from EOL. And thanks for your help.

									Hey,

Do you know what group Tim Coffing is working for? FYI -

We had only one discrepancy between the El Paso model and the CARP report for July. Our checkout with Kathy and the Settlements group took approximately five minutes, as opposed to the five days we spent sorting it out last month. Thank you for your diligence and attention to detail in dealing with El Paso - you've made me very proud. Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
KateFYI -

I've received a message similar to this one from EES for the past four days. It appears the EES sheet is not getting to EES every evening, so this is a reminder to send a spreadsheet detailing all real time trades done with EES each day to EES POWER SETTLEMENTS. Also - don't follow Geiv's example in your attempts to spell "real."

Thanks,
Kate

 the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi=
ll include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=
er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu=
siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities=
.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc=
hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services =
Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut=
ive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f=
rom Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD=
onald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executi=
ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair=
man.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak=
ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr=
esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano =
and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within =
their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=
er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t=
he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network=
 Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic=

Hey Cara,

I was discussing how there are holes in the system.  Tonight WESCO called regarding tags 26681 and 15502.  Neither is in lotus note, but both are in OATI.  I thought you might want to investigate.

Cheers,

David.Gentlemen,

West Services is short 19mw around-the-clock on Sunday and light-load Monday (7/1-7/2), as well as 23mw on-peak Monday (7/2).  We are short in SP15, at $80 on-peak and $64.25 off-peak.  We would like to either purchase the power through an SC to SC trade, or go against the ISO Imbalance, depending upon market conditions.  The associated enpower deal #'s are 669407, 669596, and 669752.  I will call in on Saturday evening to discuss market conditions and to make a decision on what needs to be done.

Thanks,

Group questions power payments
POWER CRISIS 
By Mike Taugher
CONTRA COSTA TIMES 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


An industry trade group asked market officials on Wednesday why they have failed to pay more than $1 billion for power sold during April and May.

"For some reason, the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators," said Jan Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. "Our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding."

Part of the answer, officials said, is that the state's power-buying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash.

Compounding the problem is the fact that when the May bills began coming due earlier this month, some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full, according to the Independent System Operator.

That left the ISO less able to pay its May bills, said ISO President and CEO Terry Winter in a written statement.

"The ISO acknowledges that past debt is due," Winter said in the statement.

Winter said the ISO would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by Friday. But in response to the IEP letter, he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills.

The ISO runs the spot markets in California. Buyers and sellers make their bids through the ISO, which sets the market price based on those bids, collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers. 

The issue came to a head Wednesday when the IEP sent a letter to the ISO, demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in April and May. Smutny-Jones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around $1.2 billion.

In early April, federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the ISO market. That forced the state Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity in January, to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities' customers.

DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them. 

"We haven't been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what we're going to be paid for," Hidalgo said. "We are working with the ISO to see how we can get some of that information that we're not getting."

ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said his agency is working with the water department, but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential.

"We can't tell one market participant what another market participant is doing," Fishman said.

(916) 448-9499Please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on Bloomberg:

	1. Bloomberg charges a $15 FLAT broker fee.
	2. This fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade.
	3. This fee applies each time you make a trade on Bloomberg
		i.e. $15 per hit or lift, regardless of volume
	4. When you extend a Bloomberg deal in Deal Entry, account for each separate trade accordingly 	by adding $15 to any existing broker fee.
  ******	5. Because this fee is FLAT, select the "FLAT" button to the right of the broker fee. *****
	6. And most importantly, make a note in the "BROKER" box that the broker is in fact Bloomberg.

I know that many of you were never notified of the Bloomberg fee structure, but going forward we should see every trade done on Bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with Bloomberg. The Confirms group in Houston has compiled a weighty list of "missing" hourly trades since the advent of Real Time Bloomberg trading. I believe these are all in the system, but possibly short a broker name and fee. This, going forward, should no longer be a problem.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding Bloomberg trading and/or fees.

that are at delivery point BC Border.   Total cost $ 836.06.
  

  Let me know if you have any questions.

  VirginiaMurray,
 
 Our meeting yesterday involved Bill, Kate, Mike Purcell, and myself.
The purpose of the meeting was to develop a protocol for El Paso disputes and intra-month true-up and to get an idea of how Kate's position ties in to settlements.  
 
From my understanding, our EL Paso protocol will be as such:
 
*The Model will be reconciled on a daily basis by Kate, and she will attempt true-up for the whole Model, including pre-scheduled deals
*Kate will not be responsible for Pre-scheduled deals that are incorrect
*Kate will be the point of contact for El Paso (and Houston Settlements when they have pressing matters, otherwise, Houston will contact Virginia) Bill would like to be Cc'd on all matters
*When contacted regarding an El Paso discrepancy, there will be a 3-day limit for response from the real time group
*Bill would like to be notified of any major changes that are made to the El Paso Model or to EnPower
*Houston may contact Bill at any time if they deem it necessary.  Bill would like to receive feedback and to be addressed with any compliants.
 
 
From my understanding, Kate's role will be as such:
 
*To dedicate approximately 30% of her time to the VM/Settlements group to help with true-ups and dispute resolution
*To maintain customer service contact with Roger and Kathy at El Paso and maintain daily Model to Enpower true-up
*To help maintain Montana Power service deals and make corrections according to research 
*To be a filter for disputes from VM/settlements group and to follow up on those disputes until they are settled
*Tagging & template cleanup
*Control Area Checkouts
*FSP testing
*Book Reconciliation
 
 
I will update you if things change.
 
 
Virginia

Here is a confirm that is designed to go under our EEI agreement with El Paso.  If signed, it would entirely replace our old services consulting agreement with El Paso. 

 Please read the document from a business perspective.  Do not worry too much about the legal boilerplate, of which there is plenty.  At the end of the day, the document should contain what you guys think you are doing with El Paso from a common sense perspective.  Pushing all the (very important) legal boilerplate aside:  do you see our deal in these words?? Please let me know your comments. Thanks very much ----cgyA pregunta is a question in Spanish. I am going to Seattle with my friends from FL on the 14th-15th. The Palace of Fine Arts is just this really cool place in San Fran that has huge statues (greek in nature) around this gorgeous pond with awesome flowers and trees, etc. It's so wierd just to be sitting in the city the way it is. I saw this place that looked similar but in Seattle in some movie recently, but they never said the name of the place. I just figured you might know, but thanks for the ideas.

     Sorry we missed the 1 large that your desk had coming for congestion revenue on Saterday (8/11/01).  To fix the situation I have made a manual entry for that date but since the flash has already been set and saved you will not see that change until the month end reports.  You will just have to trust that the correction was made, and look for it at month end.  I will check also when we run the month end to ensure you see the revenue.   We won't miss anymore congestion revenue.   Let me know if you have any questions.

Guys,

We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.  Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.

Please see me with questions.
Thanks,
BillGood Afternoon:

I am looking at version 1.0.0.47 the day I was checking was initally June 23, but switched over to June 20th (new data)

TEXT WRAPPING:

The text wraps in the following Fields:
	Counterparty
	Tag
	Comments

The text does not consistently wrap in the Path field, which is the most critical field to have wrap.

MISSING TRANSMISSION INFORMATION:(June 20th re-ran to check this)
	The transmission information from Trans1, Trans1Oasis seems to be coming thru (inconsistently); and I still do not see the transmission information from  Trans2, 	Trans2 Oasis represented.  I re-ran my data from the 20th to check it BUT when. I went to delete my data for the 20th, and there was none there.  Do you all know if 	this data was purposefully removed, or did it just go away? The only data that seems to have survived to this version is the data from 6/23.

SORTING:

	By Tag - I see how to make it sort in the strip, but cannot just look at tag numbers. Right now in Lotus, If i activate the sort by tag I get a list, and If I just start 	typing a tag number, it takes me to the one I want.  Can we have that Capability duplicated?  

	By Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.

EXPANDED VIEW:
	Will the Path size in the expanded view be fixed in the next release?  I still cannot see the whole path.
	The Delivery point is blank when I pull this up, but I populated border 1 and 2. What drives this?

PATH CUT: (working in June 20th data)
	I was able to sucessfully cut a path - but with the following problems
	1. Region still needs to be the forced choice that I mentioned in earlier e-mails
	2. After a path is cut, and I go into the original path, I can't see any way to easily find the cut associated with the path. Maybe a -Go to Cut- button
	3.I would like to be able to add incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each 	hour of the cut.



Question: In the expanded view of the Path under counterparty;  I see a name of a person kind of greyed out.  Who is this person? It does not match the trader name on the deal.  I looked at Williams deal # 633037.1.  Janelle Barsness shows in the path expanded view, but no trader is visible in the trade (Done on EOL).  I looked at WAPA deal # 622350.1, Kathy Crane is in the path expanded view, and Penny Casey is their trader.  

That's all for now,  catch you all on Monday

PGE has informed us that they have a couple of voice mail cards that are down.

WHAT THIS MEANS:

If a call that is going to voice mail hits one of these cards, the call will continue to ring without ever getting to voice mail. 

This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability.

If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.


THE FIX:

PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.  They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail.

The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday, 10:00 PST and should last no more than 2 hours.


Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards

Dave
Tatiana -

After researching these three deals, we've found that our group does not have access to reliable third-party documentation to support their occurrence. Because there are no Real Time confirmation letters, and no NERC Tags were done for hourly deals at the beginning of this year, it falls to cash invoices to support the validity of Real Time deals. I've spoken with Stacey White, in Houston's Risk group, and she explained to me that there are documents our Settlements group can access that may provide the information you need.

I'm sorry to keep sending you from group to group, but I'll be more than happy to help you get ahold of people who can provide you with relevant deal documentation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") June 19 order, the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ("ISO") was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions.  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all in-state load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs.  In compliance, the ISO filed, on July 10, 2001, proposed Tariff
revisions to develop:
1.)	a rate for the emission allowance charge, 
2.)	an escrow account for monies collected; 
3.)	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees; and 
4.)	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs.  
In a Market Notice posted on August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate.  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html> .
The June 19 FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude start-up fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price, and instead, to
pay generators for such start-up fuel costs, in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees.  In a Market Notice posted on
August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial start-up fuel charge rate.
The ISO has modified the previously posted start-up fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this
rate.  This information is also posted at

As you are aware, Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E") and the California
Power Exchange ("PX") have filed petitions for relief in the United States
Bankruptcy Court that are the subject of ongoing proceedings.  As we have
advised in prior Market Notices, each of these parties is substantially in
default of obligations -- pre-petition and/or post-petition -- incurred on
its behalf in one of more of the ISO markets.  The amounts owing have
resulted in a substantial reduction in monies paid out by the ISO to market
participants.  Accordingly, Market Participants likely have claims or other
legal rights they may wish to assert in either or both of the bankruptcy
proceedings.
Attached is a Market Notice that discusses the ISO's and Market
Participants' responsibilities to file such claims with the  bankruptcy
court.  Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to

							There are a few changes to Saturday's schedule, so please disregard my previous email.
------------------------------------------------------

Group,

The plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for Saturday, 6/9.  The plan is as follows:

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called.  This is due to the ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes.  We don't want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

So, please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade.  Below is their preschedule, mw's available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID's.  Also, attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone #'s.  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.  

Harbor:		HARBGN_7_UNITS
Supps:		No action required, they are down for maintenance on Saturday.
SC Trade:	No action required, they are down for maintenance on Saturday.

Delano:	PANDOL_6_UNITS
Supps:		15mw available, 30mw prescheduled, total output equals 45, HE1-24, Saturday, for $40.
SC Trade:	15mw available, 30mw prescheduled, total output equals 45, SP15, Saturday, above $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:	MARTEL_2_AMFOR
Supps:		3mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 10, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $50.
SC Trade:	3mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 10, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Holding:		We don't know their unit ID because we're not their SC
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	15mw available, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,
Stan

Subject:	As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets."

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.   

-KitGood Morning/Afternoon/Evening;

I started working in June 22 to test path cut capabilities.  I was able to save a cut path.  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready. Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time.

A Real Time Question:
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance, as it sometimes is at night, will this application still function?  If not, we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained.


Re-Running June 20th as a completely new day: This entire test was done in local Enpower

PreSchedule Workspace:

Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got "List index out of bounds (4)" error *needs fix
	
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states "ERROR:" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. " Unable to locate" "can't find last row!", and "Failed to export summary!" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the "ok" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

    

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara

We're short 25 mw on peak at Palo under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW. Reduce purchases from El Paso to $4 and sell back to them at $0. Deals are as follows:

717316 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $76

717317 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $76

717318 - STSW buys EPE
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $76

Also, STWBOM is short to the day-ahead market 25 mw on peak at SP15 at a price of $68.14.

Please let me know if you have questions about these procedures.

Thanks,
KateBill:

We had a variance in the SAR for the West BOM Book on Friday night.  It was due to a 9 mw purchase from short term cali that was used to fill the lending we have with El Paso Electric.  We in a purchase from the imbalance under the WBOM Book (deal #727440), and built an annuity (deal #72741) where short term cali sold us the 9 MW @ $43.00.  If this is not the correct to remedy the variance please advise me of what to do next time.

Good Morning Keoni,

I have a question relating to one of our customers who is short of reserves.  We know that it is possible to buy Replacement capacity.  I wanted to confirm with you that we are able to be exercised on that capacity.  Assuming this is the case, I am unsure of how the charge would work for this capacity purchase.  For example, if we bid $40 to purchase the capacity and the MCP is $30--is our payment as-bid ($40) or the MCP ($30)?

Thanks,

Kourtney
503-464-8280I can benchpress 70 lbs now. Cool, eh? oh yeah baby. So no luck with the soccer gig? I'm sure you'll get faster it'll just take some time. I'm still running slower than I should be which sucks, but hey you just gotta keep going. I've definitely made noticable progress which helps keep me motivated, but it's still kinda annoying-but in a good motivational way. 

on another note, did you see that special sauce band when they played?

BMark -

The ad hoc team's product is attached.  It is a suggested revision to the
NERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are:

*	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The
table provides rules for the e-tag software to automatically set the flag.

*	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e.,
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval
entities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags,
etc.).  But, a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome
review/approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced
world of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the suggested
incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer
the submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we considered three
parameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and the default
composite status.

	*	The assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag
Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag.
Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the
final composite status.

	*	Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite
status does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if
appropriate.

	*	The default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to Denied.

	For real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where
Purchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.

	*	Tags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred
to 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to
deferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite
status of Late).

*	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard.  The
team was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to
include in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on
the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times
on the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion.

*	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agent's time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service.

*	Here's a big one - because the timing table allows for later
submittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the
hour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the
feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour (i.e., starts
at 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would align the WSCC with the
Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals.

*	There was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice
for the tariff deadline for schedule changes (most are set to 20 before the
start).  It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to
change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner.

*	The team did not want to address at this time issues concerning
multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy 3 or the
E-Tag specifications.

*	Finally, the team can not stress enough that a composite status of
Late should not and does not mean automatic denial.  The Late designation
simple indicates that the default composite status is Denied.  Approval
entities should make every effort to assess all tags, Late or not.

Hurray for the team members, many, many thanks.

Subject:	Palo Verde  Bottleneck - PLEASE READ
Importance:	High

Is this the only revision you'd like to see?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to ensure that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee to fill the lending short, then enter a zero priced buy-resale to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 27 2001

SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators.

The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp.

"In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost," said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market.

"The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand," he said. "If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."

Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants.

The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit.

On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis.

Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times.

The Cal-ISO report singled out "Supplier 5," identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company "continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."

Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, "The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood." Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted.

Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, "We're looking at the data, and we question whether or not it is correct."

A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks.

Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour.

The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said.

Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19, he said.

The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts.

As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes.

Kate and Bill,

  We got the bill for Tranny losses for April trasmission.   Both ST_W_HRLY and WBOM had some charges.  Please let me know if you would like me to put the two annuities that are hilighted in red together under the ST_W_HRLY book, or if you want them separated between the ST_W_HRLY and WBOM books.

  Thanks,

 Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm?

A reminder....

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

As always, let me know if you have questions about this.

Kate

Dear Melissa or Thresa,

  I have completed DMS's # 8704 and 8699 for Sierra Pacific.  The total of the two will be a negative $ 9033.39 impact on the real time books.  
  I was wondering if we could pull this change thru today so that it comes thru in the next PMA report?
  I know Amy will be back July 2, so I was wondering if someone could do it for her. The real time book will be taking another $10,000 hit soon, so I wanted to split these 2 big    hits between 2 PMA reports if at all possible.

  Please let me know.

  Thanks,

  VirginiaAlthough we hate to lose her, Holli has resigned from her position with Enron in Portland to pursue other career interests.  She will be coming in later this week or next to say her goodbyes, but other than that she will not be in.  Please refer any business or phone calls that you would have referred to Holli to me, or, in my absence, to John Malowney or Stewart Rosman.

As announced in a market notice last Thursday, July 19, the ISO is
considering new processes for implementing the must-offer obligation that
would permit compliance with the FERC's Order and also take into
consideration the particular concerns of generating units with long start-up
times and operating costs that may not be fully recoverable during periods
of relatively low Energy prices.
The ISO has posted on its web site a Draft Proposal that is intended to
provide Market Participants with an opportunity to comment upon and discuss
some modifications the ISO is considering to the procedures described in
last Thursday's market notice that addressed granting a "Temporary Waiver of
Must-Offer Obligation."   You can find the draft at

NEVP called at 21:00 and informed us the cut.  Dynegy was not able to resupply the energy so I bought APS tranny and power from EPE for $70.00 and will show it in the EL PASO model as a sell from EPE to DYNEGY 8MW @ $70 Palo Verde.  The Tranny from APS was $3.50, and I will show an annuity for this amount billed to Dynegy.  I built two annuities for the tranny purchase from APS and its subsequent billing to Dynegy (674830 & 674831).  The EPEC deals that relate to the cut are 674832 and 674833.

Dear all,

Regarding the email I sent below, for deal #442038 and #442872, they were originally entered in Oct, 2000 for ST-Whourly book to receive annuity amount of $53,518.94 from Saguaro and $172,518.16 from Las Vegas Cogen respectively. However, they were supposed to be for ST-Wserv to receive those money because at that time, ST-WServ book was not set up yet. These amounts had already gone through to ST-Whouly book in 11/30/00 P&L as PMA. In Jun 2001, the deals were changed to ST-WServ book but they were not actually picked up by settlement and Risk (as the deals have already liquidated, i.e., strip dates are passed). In order to reflect the change in desk, we need to put in two annuities today:

#683673 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $53,518.94

#683684 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $172,518.16

These amounts will be showing up in 7/12 P&L as New Deals for a total of $226,037.10 (inflow to St-WServ and outflow to St-Whourly).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I would like to summarize our discussion on those deals we have had questions about (as described in the previous emails), in terms of when and how they will be come through or corrected in the coming future. Please review and let me know if they are not correct:

1. #442038 - the change in the annuity amount of $4,706.28 (from $53,518.94 to $48,812.66) will be coming through in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July) as an outflow to ST-WServ book. 
Chris and Les - I will put in a new annuity deal for the amount of $53,518.94 for St-WServ book sell to St-Whourly to reflect the change in desk (from St-Whourly to St-WServ) of the deal; the desk change made on 4/17 was not picked up by settlement as they were not informed. With the adjustment, the net effect of $48,812.66 will be given back to WServ.

2. #584331 - it will come through in June desk analysis

3. #600480 & #595779 - since these are interdesk deals, we will take care of it by entering two new annuity deals today (#680210 & #680220). They were not picked up by settlement as PMA when they were entered on 5/2 & 4/29 because they were interdesk deals.

4. #598971(leg 1-5) - they will show up in July desk analysis (= PMA at the end of August)

5. #442872 - the change in the annuity amount of $126,542.87 (from $172,518.16 to $45,975.29) will be coming through in Jun desk analysis as an outflow to ST-WServ book.
Again, the change in desk (from St-Whouly to St-WServ) will then be reflected by a new annutiy deal for $172,518.16 with ST-WServ sell to ST-Whouly.

6. #666350 & #666351 - they will show up in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July)

Please feel free to correct or add anything to the above information.

Thanks,
Samantha
503.464.7248Hey Guys!

I went through all the templates and removed the RT prefix for all the templates. You can now sort them alphabetically making the process of finding the right template a lot easier. From now on please do no use the RT prefix when creating new templates.

GeirI am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, "Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower "short name" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

Bill/Greg:

Harbor Cogen is finishing up installation of its 30 MW steam turbine.  This is in addition to their 80 MW gas turbine.  This turbine is going to be dispatchable by the ISO.  We will need to communicate dispatch instructions back to Harbor.  I still have a ways to go to fully understand how this is going to work with respect to payments, etc., but one thing we need to do is get set up so we can receive dispatch instructions from the ISO as we do for the ADS.  Apparently, the SRA is a little different than the ADS.  Can you call this guy and figure out what we need to do to receive SRA dispatch instructions from the ISO?

Thanks

Tom Halter from Gas Recovery System will be calling over the weekend.  They will be coming back from an outage over the weekend.  They have 8mw available in SP15.  Just give him your bid, and if he accepts it, you will confirm the transaction over the APX trade application.  Just click on the "Bilateral" button in the APX, and then all you have to do is highlight the bilateral trade at the bottom, right click, and then click "confirm bilateral."

Subject:	October 2000 activity

I had sent an e-mail to Diana around 4/24, and since then it looks like some of the discrepancies have been cleared up, but a few still remain.  They are as follows:

10/3 - deal #425449.1 & 425450.1 need adder of $0.25, not $0.10.

10/4 - deal #426611.1 & 426612.1 need adder of $0.25, not $0.10.  ALSO, on our purchase side only, HE 24 was cut 10mw realtime due to DC derate.  This is the only side that was cut.  Notification was at 23:34.

10/5 - EPMI is missing the "cutable" 10mws for HE 11-21 on both sides.  However, HE 8 on our sales side also has 10mw.  Realtime made a straight sale, but it should have been an in and an out.  We paid inadvertent (per Bill Casey, Mgr), and will only show it on our sales side to you.  The "cutable" deal is index + $1.00.

10/7:  "Cutable" deal is missing HE 1 and 9-24 (10mw) from both sides,

10/13:  "Cutable" deal is missing HE 1,2 & 6-23, (10mw) from both sides.

10/14:  HE 7 & 8 (50mw) was cut due to DC derate.  It looks like 25mw was removed from HE 8, but 50mw still needs to be removed from HE 7 & 25mw from HE 8.  In addition, our control area was notified by BPA we were also out with you HE 6 by 50mw.  These changes only need to be made on our purchases from EPMI.  We balance on our sales to EPMI.

10/25 & 26 - cutable deal (listed on daily sheets), HE 2-6 = 2mw, HE 9-22 = 3mw, HE 23 & 24 = 2mw) needs to be priced at $1.00 adder.  It's currently included with deal #441439.2 on 10/25 and deal #441533.1 on 10/26.

The rest of October is good.  I hope to have November discrepancies to you soon.

Good Afternoon Fred,

After our call, a better solution presented itself to me.  The best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by EPE would come from EPE directly to Enron's real time group.  

Please see the following prototype sheet that I have made, I have checked with Bill and Greg, and they both agree that this format will give Real time the hourly shapes that they need, with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr.  This sheet could be created and sent after the E-tag deadline has passed, giving EPE's group ample time to get all the information that they need before Real time would ever need it.

Since E-tag is a fact of life for all of us now, we would benefit the most by building E-tag into our solution.  By comparing the E-tags that EPE recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties, EPE has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves.  Enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see, without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers.

Having EPE generate this abbreviated sheet for EPMI real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have.

Please take a look at this sheet, and see how you like it.  Real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be "On Call" for that day.  

I welcome any questions or comments:

Cara Semperger

Dear Bill, Kate, and Les,

   I wanted to let you all know what we are doing concerning deals # 524528.1 (purchase from Willamet)  and 524529.1 (sale to PACE).  
I believe that we are all now familiar with the details of these deals.   Mike, Geir, Les, and I have spent a combined 4 hours or more researching this deal over the last month.  Our last resort is to pull the tapes.  As we do not have access to our tapes and I am not sure when we will have them back, we have decided to do the following until we have the tapes back and can verify that the sale to PAC did take place:  

* I have extended the sale of 4 MW's of Willamet generation to PAC to include HE 13.  
* I have TEMPORARILY zero'd out the HE 14-24 piece of this deal on the PAC side with notes

As the payment is 3 months overdue, we will pay now and get reimbursed if we find that we are correct.

Please share any thoughts with me that you may have.

Thanks to everyone for your help in researching this.

VirginiaBill - 

  Kate and I are still working on MPC's March checkouts.  That was the messy month that we had discrepancies almost every day and I sent out a big e-mail to the whole group and listed problems with the names of who was on shift that day.
When we finish the MPC checkout, you should see a credit for $ 5360.00 for the purchase side.


  Thanks,
  Virginia

If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal,

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Subject:	PMA's

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

 - Mtg Dates.xls After the Day ahead market ran, the Path 15 branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 1275 MW to 1000 MW and the Path 26 branch group
TTC in both directions was changed from 3000 MW to 2800 MW for HE's 1100 and
1200 for operating day 8/14/01.  The reason(s) for the change is due to the
lines being de-energized for CB test.  The first applicable Hour Ahead
market to run with these values is HE 1100.  The ISO will update you of any
changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please

The appearance of FERC commissioners before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee the Wednesday after next is probably driving the timing of the FERC's meeting next Monday at which they will consider CA matters.  It is possible that FERC is trying to fashion a "silver bullet" to use at the Senate hearing.  The article below also discusses Feinstein's allegations of undue influence at FERC.  Ray


Lieberman summons FERC members for hearing
Gas Daily, June 8, 2001

Taking a lead from Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., said Wednesday that he would haul FERC commissioners before the Senate Gov-ernmental
Affairs Committee to find out if the agency has exercised proper oversight of
electric rates. The hearings promise to put further heat on FERC, which has thus far resisted
calls to impose price caps on the California power market.

Lieberman said he would hold a hearing on June 20 to find out "whether the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission has been properly executing its duties to provide 'fair and
reasonable' electric rates." The call for hearings was Lieberman's first move upon becoming
head of the committee.

"In the immediate future, I hope to focus the committee's oversight and investigate duties
on an examination of high energy prices and what can be done to lower them," Lieberman said.
That agenda should cheer California's Senate delegation and California Gov. Gray Davis,
who have accused FERC of dereliction of duty when it comes to monitoring the state's energy
markets. Lieberman's announcement, in fact, comes in direct response to a plea from Feinstein to
launch an investigation into FERC's relationship with the industry it is charged with monitoring.

In a letter to Lieberman following the recent Senate power shift, Feinstein hinted at the
"undue influence" that the energy industry exercises over the commission. FERC, said Feinstein,
has failed "to fulfill its legally mandated function under the Federal Power Act to restore 'just
and reasonable' electricity rates" (GD 5/31).

Feinstein's concerns were prompted in part by a New York Times report that Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay had attempted to lobby FERC for increased retail competition and access to transmission
lines. According to the newspaper, Lay offered FERC Chairman Curt Hebert a tit-for-tat
deal in which Hebert would help expedite retail competition in exchange for political support.
Hebert reportedly refused the deal - and Lay disputed Hebert's account of the conversation.

A PBS news special co-produced by the Times may further help bolster public perceptions
that the industry is unreasonably close to FERC, however. According to the program, which
aired Tuesday, FERC did not move ahead with an investigation of alleged manipulation of the
California natural gas market until after the Times made certain confidential documents public.

FERC sent the case to an administrative law judge on March 28 - one day after a story
ran in the Times on the controversy surrounding El Paso Natural Gas' leasing of capacity to
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy (GD 4/29). Prior to that, coverage of the story had been
limited largely to the trade press.

Establishing that FERC has indeed failed to follow federal guidelines for just and reasonable
rates may prove difficult, however. At a recent meeting of the Energy Bar Association in
Washington, D.C., Douglas Smith, former general counsel with FERC, noted the difficulty in
finding criteria for establishing just and reasonable rates; no statute, he said, spells out the
terms precisely (GD 4/27). NH

 I received a stack of Bloomberg hourly confirms today, apparently for deals they didn't see in our system. Turns out Craig Dean entered Ryan's Bloomberg deals for 6/13 and 6/14, but wasn't aware of the fee or the need to enter it in the deal. Just wanted you to be aware that I've added fees to the following deals so you (or I) can watch for them on Monday's DPR.

Let me know if you have questions, or see problems arise due to these changes.

WTC voicemail is down.  The link between WTC and Qwest is not working.   PGE has reported the problem at 5:50am and we are waiting to hear what's happening.    
 
Quick reminder on what can occur when voicemail goes down and what your might experience when the link comes back up:
 
1) The message waiting light won't go off after you retrieve your messages. If this occurs just have the person lift the handset, hear dial tone and dial,  113. This will clear the message waiting light.
 
2) The message waiting light is not on and you could have a message.    Have employees check their mailbox just in case they are expecting critical messages.  The next voicemail will activate the message waiting light.   
 
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. 
 
 
		Energy Exchange Program Neutrality Adjustment
		Charge Type 1487
		SC Settlement Contacts:

		Background
		As you may know, the Energy Exchange Program began on trade
date 11/14/2000.  In this program the ISO obtained needed energy in for the
real time market and, rather that paying for the energy as a purchase, later
returned the energy in another period.  This was not necessarily a
one-for-one exchange.  The incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned, a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued.  Since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently, there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the ISO. The ISO created Charge Type 1487 was
developed for the allocation of the cost to SCs participating in the market
during the incoming schedules

		Notification
		The ISO has created Charge Type 1487 so that whenever an
Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance, the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the SC's based on their total
negative Uninstructed Energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place.  This new Charge Type will appear beginning on the
June 30, 2001 statements which will be published on August 23, 2001.  In
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as December, 2000
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data.

		CT 1487 is a semi automated charge, meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated, but it will be a manual charge type
within the Manual Line Item Records and will not require a change to your
settlement system.  Note that this charge will not appear on every
statement, but only when an Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance.  


		If you have any questions, please contact your Client
Relations Account Manager.

Notification of Operating Procedure Update

*	The following new or revised ISO Operating Procedures have been
implemented and are posted for reference on the ISO Website.

ISO Operating Procedure posted:  T-152 Huntington Beach Power Plants 1-4
Split Bus Operation
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 8-16-2001
Procedure Purpose: The previously inactive Huntington Beach units 3 and 4
have been re-powered and are scheduled to be in service August 2001.  The
existing units 1, 2 and 5 presently provide 563 MW of power.  The added
re-powered units, rated 220 MW each, achieve a total plant capacity of 1003
MW.  If all units, including units 3 and 4, are concurrently on-line,
additional stress will be placed on the 230 kV circuit breakers (CBs) at
Huntington Beach, Hinson, and Villa Park substations, thereby exceeding
their rated interrupting capability.  This procedure will provide guidelines
for operation of the Huntington Beach 230 kV buses in order to reduce short
circuit duty contribution from the Huntington Beach units.
Changes / Reasons: see attached
 <<T-152 Procedure Change Description V1.0.doc>>

To all -

I think we're all aware of the changes made to account for the Wheelabrator outage on 6/17 and 6/18, but here's a recap just in case:

Annuities killed - 679980/679973/679991/679995/678497/678498/678495/678496

Deals changed - 650407 (changed from STCA buys Cal Imb to STWServices buys Cal Imb)
		650408 (" " ")
		650577/650580/650583/650604 (changed from STWHourly sells to Wheelabrator to 		STWHourly sells to STWServices)

Deals added - 680366 (STWServices sells Cal Imb for 6/17-6/18)
	         680347 (STWServices sells to STCA for 6/17)
	         680349 (STWServices sells to STCA for 6/18)	

For a more detailed account of the path we outlined for that day, check the spreadsheet located at P://RealTime/Kate/Wheelabrator_6-17_6-18. And let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for all of your help and patience.

Kate         Per several conversations with Mirant (our upstream) and Pinwest (our downstream) the following situation occurred on July 19th between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.   

Deal #694398 $41.00 our purchase from Mirant
Deal #693496 $40.75 our sale to Pinwest

Mirant(G)sp15-Ciso(t)sp15/pv5#scem_sp15_pv-Mirant-Epmi-Pinwest-aps(t)pv/ww#gf-Pinwest

Mirant was cut by the CISO per Dan at the Mirant Real-time group.  He was unable to re-supply an upstream.  Pinwest would not allow the schedule to flow on a real-time basis per Carla on the scheduling desk.  Enron agreed to bookout out with Pinwest and bill LD's to Mirant.   I spoke with Glen Ryan at Pinwest at about 3:30 to agree on a price at which Enron would buy back the power in order to bookout.  He said it would have to be the purchase price which was $345.00.   In a later conversation about 3:45, I told Pinwest that we would not agree to the purchase price of $345.00 and that the current market price was around $45.00 - $50.00 per mw hour.    They would not agree to the current market price and will bill us L.D.'s.

Real time desk is short 5 mw HE 1-24 on Saturday 7/14 thru Monday 7/16 at Hot Springs to Cenex (a middle marketing customer in MPC control area.)  This power can be filled with the Frontier Energy if you chose and give them prevailing Mid C price .  If you fill it with the Frontier just use the account number for MPCO that is in the Frontier sheet when you call BPA.  If not pruchase this power at Hot Springs as I  have told Cenex we will be delivering it there.   In any event Real Time MUST CALL MPCO AND INFORM THEM AS SOON AS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE FILLING THIS FROM.  I have already discussed this with Mike at MPC and they are aware that we are purchasing on behalf of Cenex but you still must call.  

We are short at the follwing prices:

I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: 

(1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and 

(2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. 

If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733.  

Thanks,
Donna

Subject: CAISO Notice - ISO Compliance Filing on June 19 FERC Order
Importance: High



	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or

Ed,
 
I checked with LVC on tube materials and condenser operating conditions for Unit #1. Unit #1 has had no indication of corrosion but the water used for cooling tower makeup is well water and is low in chlorides. 
 
Units 2 & 3 will be using city water and the chlorides will be in the 300 mg/l range. (The following is courtesy of Mike Wisdom and various SS manuals) 316L SS has a moly percentage in the 2 - 3% range. In the past (before computer control of alloying) the Mo percentage was typically in the 2.5+% range. The testing that was done on corrosion resistance was done on 2.5% Mo SS. 317L SS has a Mo percentage in the 3 - 4% range, 317LXN SS has a Mo percentage in the 4 - 5% range. The 317L alloys are recommended for use in high chloride concentration streams at elevated temperatures. 317L SS would be the material of choice if the cost difference is not prohibitive. 
 
I hope this helps.

The drainage ditch issue is still precipated by the eventuality that a sound wall will be constructed.    If the sound wall is constructed there will have to be a minimum distance that must be maintained above the 26 foot.  The added cost for higher , larger towers have to be considred.  The drainage ditch will not be constructed for four years in the future so the  transmission lines cannot extend into the easement area. 

However, if we put the culverts in now before transmission lines are constructed then the city MAY allow the penetration into the easement. 

For sure if we hang transmission lines into the facility site we will get an interference claim from the Contractor.

I will investigate farther the recommended change in condenser materials.  As it now stands we are only asking for the additional costs.  I have checked the Scope of  Work and it is silent on the tube spec.  By copy the wisdom and chemielwski please provide the technical justification for the change in materials.  In the days when I was a member of nace  SS was not recommendeed in any service that had chlorides in excess of 60 ppm due to stress cracks caused by the chlorides.

Hi Bill:

I work with Neil Bresnan in Houston and I'm responsible for entering the real-time deals into the database. I was hoping that whoever creates the real-time sheet that you send to us could just put in the delivery point instead of including both points in a spread deal. I think it would be easier for anyone entering the deals here to just have the delivery point. Hope I have made my request clear, please let me know if I need to clarify this further.

Subject:	FSP Milestone Complete

Good Afternoon,

I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed the 10 day parallel test milestone for FSP.  We were also seeing solid performance for our key metrics during the parallel (template writing 1:30 - 2:30, finals processing 5-7 minutes).  Lastly, based on my understanding of our go-live bet, my total debt owed to Tim Belden = $13.00.  Tim, I gave the money to Debra.

What Next?

User Training
I will be working with the DA & Real time guys to make sure everyone is up-to-speed with the new system.  We are also in the process of developing some user documentation cheat sheets to help in the transition.

Production Parallel
We have already begun using FSP in parallel in production by writing templates in FSP & comparing them to CAPS.  We will continue doing this until we are getting consistent results between the two systems.  This production parallel has necessitated some changes to the existing Enpower_to_CAPS report that we have already started modifying.

How long? 

Once bit, twice shy.  No money on this one, but I don't think it should take over a week to train the users.  The production parallel may take a little longer.  I am really relying on the users to wrap this one up.  Kysa Alport has already volunteered for this duty and I spent a good part of today training her.  

Thanks,  David Poston  To all -

I've trued up the El Paso model and Enpower for June. Most of these variances were simple adjustments to the model, and we should be variance-free for June at this point. Also, I've notified the Real Time traders that we will re-instate the El Paso reconciliation model as of July 1. 

Please call me with questions.

Thanks for looking into this, and for your quick response. I'm not sure which databases you're looking at (possibly East Real Time?), but I've attached a list of the four databases the new Portland Real Time traders need access to. The traders names are: Darin Presto; John C. Anderson; Michael Mier. Of course, their need for a Lotus Notes account is implicit in this request. Beyond that, they need the following:

However, I did locate:

Bill, the $108.08 price you see in Footnote #3 of the e-mail titled CAISO
Notice: Correction of FERC June 19 Order Market Notice is the highest hourly
ex-post price during the last Stage 1.  The $91.87 price is 85% of $108.08

The last Stage 1 occurred on Trade Date 5/31/01, HE 10 and 11.  A Stage 2

Number 17, August 2001
Negotiation In Emotional Circumstances

Our website's advice section gets questions on a wide
variety of topics from all over the world.  Recently a
web visitor posed a question that many of us face. 
Often as our own children are establishing themselves
as adults, we're faced with issues relating to care for
older relatives.

Here's our reader's question and our response:

Convincing Elders To Accept Care

Question: As a hospital/geriatric social worker, both
in my personal and work life I am frequently asked the
following question:  "My elderly [parent, aunt,
neighbor...] clearly needs some help at home, but
refuses this help [even if free, or done by a family
member, a church...].  How can I convince this person
to accept help?"

After I've determined that the issue isn't financial
(usually a solvable problem), then I am frequently at a
loss.  The situations I've seen like this seem to only
resolve after a crisis occurs, and the person has no
choice. 

How would you approach a situation like this?  The
issues seem to revolve around pride, retaining control,
denial of illness, aging or disability...  Any
thoughts?

Response: In his 'Notes From The Underground',
Dostoevsky wrote, "Human behavior is motivated by the
craving for absolute freedom and self-assertion in
defiance of all dictates of reason."  As decrepitude
takes its toll on our bodies -- and minds -- often
pride is the only thing we have left.

Waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who
think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to
organizing care for people who have less and less
capacity to take care of themselves or their personal
surroundings.

Probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of
questions.  Using the example of children of an elderly
parent, first the concerned children need to ask
themselves what are their own interests.  Do they want
to assuage guilt?  Do they fear that harm will come to
their parent?  Are they concerned that a crisis will
interrupt the normal course of their own lives?

Questions also need to be asked of the parent: What
most concerns you about your situation -- health,
comfortable surroundings, companionship, your capacity
to hold your head up and say, "Daughter please! I can
do it myself!"  One can also ask, "What do you think
are the standards that determine one's capacity to live
an independent life?"

This questioning approach brings the parties into
fuller participation in the decision-making process. 
When I ask you a question it means I am taking you
seriously; the reverse is equally true.  In
negotiation, this technique is called Active Listening.

The crucial element is listening closely to all the
elements of the responses to those questions, both the
questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of
other people.  It is no less important to respond to
what people say by checking to make sure you've
understood their points; you may want to say, "This is
what I understood you to have said; is my understanding
correct?"  You also want to indicate, "The fact that I
understand what you have said does not necessarily mean
I agree with you."

Clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is
a critical vital sign.  The fear of loving relatives
that something bad can happen has to be balanced
against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their
self-esteem, you are attacking a most vulnerable part
of their anatomy.  You cannot negotiate away a person's
self-esteem, but you can destroy it through frontal and
flanking attacks.

The frustration faced by folks who see loved ones
failing to take proper care of themselves is
phenomenal.  Very often the people who have advocated
professional care ultimately must mutter (hopefully to
themselves) the unsatisfying statement, "I told you
so."

In your question you indicate that crisis forces
choice.  Perhaps the best approach is to prepare a
safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs.  It
cannot prevent a crisis from happening; and it is
crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by
forcing the 'victim' of it to lose face. But having
that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of
the fall.

Relationship is one of the seven most significant
issues to consider in negotiation.  Focusing on the
relationship with an elderly parent or friend, not
letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring
can make it much easier when someone's self-esteem is
attacked by a crisis.  Looking at oneself and saying,
"It's not my fault," is not a way of avoiding blame,
but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their
own mistakes -- just as they did the first time they
gave us the keys to the car.

	Re:	Arrangements to Accommodate FERC's June 19, 2001 Order

Dear ____________________:

	The Montana Power Company ("MPC") and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI") are parties to a Confirmation Letter dated December 20, 1999 (the term of which has been extended by letter dated __________________) under which EPMI has been purchasing energy for resale to MPC or selling energy received from MPC into the wholesale market.  As you are no doubt aware, the FERC issued an Order on June 19, 2001 that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the WSCC.  

One restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers, such as EPMI, may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the California ISO ("California Cap").  Generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices.  As a result, at times (such as during this week's heat wave which caused blackouts in Las Vegas) EPMI may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the West at a price below the California Cap.  Because EPMI cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the California Cap to MPC, we cannot purchase such energy on MPC's behalf for resale to MPC.  

However, in order to continue to serve MPC's needs at times of peak demand, scarce supply, and high prices, EPMI proposes the following solution:

1.	If EPMI is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the California Cap, EPMI will strive to meet MPC's energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to MPC and for MPC to pay the generator directly. 
2.	EPMI will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer, who will be paying the generator directly for that energy.
3.	EPMI will notify MPC of the identity of the seller, along with the amount to be paid the seller, and provide other information and assistance to enable MPC to pay the seller directly. 
4.	All other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged.
 
	We believe this proposal allows EPMI to continue to meet MPC's needs, while complying with Federal law.  If you have another proposal, or would like to discuss this matter further, please feel free to call either Christian Yoder at (503) 464-7845 or Steve Hall at (503) 464-7795.

Attached please find the prior month adjustment items we got from Settlements for WHOURLY book.  The total P&L impact is 
-$82,555.76.  Please note that this is still preliminary and please review and verify them (* I will do the same).  I am sending them to you just to give you a heads up.

In some of the items Settlements didn't put the deal number under explanation.  I have sent out an email to them so we can know what those adjustments are for.  At this time of the month Settlements are usually overwhelmed by questions and requests so they might not get back to us before Risk needs to finalize the dpr on next Tuesday morning for 8/31.  If you feel uncomfortable taking any one of the items in your 8/31's P&L due to unclear explanation or other reasons, please let me know.

Good Afternoon Ron,

We just had a meeting with Bill Williams, head of real-time trading in Portland, to discuss some problems we are having with the real-time deals flowing to the Deal Confirmation system.  Currently, the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real-time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups.  One possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real-time traders use deal entry to make all the changes.  This solution will NOT work.  If the real-time guys start changing the deals in deal entry, the original negotiated deal will be lost.  Also, and more importantly, the time to make all the changes for the real-time adjustments in Deal Entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing.

Thanks,  David Poston
IT Manager, Portland
This is just to let everyone who is using the New Curve Manager in Enpower:
The Curve Manager is having a problem in Terminal Server 2. (NAHOU-TRDTS2) The problem is currently being diagnosed by both the Enpower Team and Terminal Server Team in Houston. As Soon as it is fixed, I will let everyone know. For now you can use any other terminal server session (i.e. TRDTS1, or TRDTS03 - TRDTS5) for running the Curve Manager.

Kate:
please see below in Red for answers to your questions.
In addition to the items I sent you for WHOURLY, settlements advised there are three additional items we need to take:
1. BPA transmission actualization to invoicing, amount =+$12,896 => deal number unknown at this moment.  Settlements is looking it up.  Would you want me to take this or do you want Settlements to find out the deal number first? 
2. price change for deal#479827.1 after liquidated, amount = +$1,625
3. deal added (#556989.1) after flow date passed, amount = +$11,375

Please advise if you have any questions.

CRCommunications@caiso.comBill,
I have completed a spreadsheet for the AT & T Wireless usage of your group.  I'm not sure how much of help this will be to you as of now, since I just got Kate on the group plan and also a couple others (that were set-up before my time).   I can go over it with you if you have time, but it might be something you would want me to track for the next couple of months to see how much it varies.    Just let me know.
Thanks, JillI received a call from Charlie at EPE.  If possible, when you create a tag for EPE, please use a slash instead of a semicolon in the "Info Section" in the Transaction Path.  Apparently they are having problems uploading the tags into their system when semicolons are present.  They are trying to fix this problem as soon as they can. See below for more clarification:


For example, instead of G;FS;PV and L;FS use G/FS/PV and L/FS.

We'll be short 50 mw on peak at Palo - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW - at a price of $49. Buy to fill this real time. Reduce El Paso purchase prices to $4. Sell back to El Paso at $0. Here are the day-ahead deals....

732687 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $49

732692 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 25 mw @ $49

732696 - STSW buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $49

Also, STWBOM is short 25 mw on peak in SP15 at a day-ahead price of $44.27. (STCALI is short 100 mw off-peak, SP15, at day-ahead price of $31.02.)

Please enter all purchases using the same book name used in the day-ahead sale. If STCA is short, STCA needs to buy the energy to fill that. I am still running into errors regarding this procedure. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
KateFYI -

Although the El Paso CARP for 7/12 said there were no variances between it and the model, not one of the totals in our model matched up with the totals on the CARP. In addition, the reconciliation model showed no variances on the purchase side, and had no information on the sale side. Several formulas in the model were either missing or incorrect, and one preschedule purchase was missing, although it was highlighted on the CARP printout. 

I'm not sure why this happened, but whatever it is I'm sure you guys didn't mean to send it to Kathy looking like this. If you have any questions, take a look at the CARP and model printout for 7/12 to see what I'm talking about. Thanks for your attention to this matter.

KateCara,

Tag 22874 got curtailed Day Ahead from 5 MW to 2 Mw for HE 10-17PDT. Christine at Aquilla said that the tranny from BC Border was cut. I created a new tag that reflects this change. The new tag # 23366. I also notified EWEB and BPA.

Monika
Due to ISO computer problems the Hour Ending 0600 Ex-Post price for
08-27-2001 is not correct.  The 10 minute interval prices for interval 5 and
6 are also incorrect.  The correct Ex-Post price for Hour Ending 0600 will
be posted with in the next 96 hours. . Sent by Market Operations.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice. 
I talked with the same reporters yesterday (with Palmer and Shapro).

Any other information that you can supply Gary would be appreciated.  Steve, did Gary A. get your original as the CAISO turns email?

Subject: Busy Day with the LA Times


Investigative Reporters at the LA Times called me today (I'm not going
to say who, but they are long-time pros, don't worry about that) asking
questions about the enormous amount of Out of Market (OOM) energy being
purchased by the ISO.  They wanted to know if this was due to the
DWR/CERS long-term contracts?  They wanted to know if this is effecting
the real-time markets.

The answers, of course, is yes.  However, I need you folks to help me
collect information from your settlements people substantiating what is
currently conjecture.  That is, the OOM costs are being allocated to
Scehduling Coordinators who are "short" in their hourly schedules.  Your
generators may be buying real-time energy from the ISO, thinking they
are getting a bargain, only to discover 60 days later, or more, that an
enormous OOM charge has been allocated to your company.  That is highway
robbery.  Help me put some evidence to this.

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.Stephanie -
I believe I've found these trades. The first one already had Bloomberg in as the broker along with the appropriate flat fee. The second deal did not have a broker or fee in it - those have been added. Please let me know if you still don't see the trades.

639921 (Geir Solberg) - Sell AEP/25 MW/SP-15/$105 - Deal flows hours 14 through 18, and broker fee reflects $15 flat times 4 trades - $60

640346 (David Porter) - Sell TransAlta/50 MW/SP-15/$105 - Deal flows for HE 16, and broker fee reflects $15

Thanks,
Kate

3WTC, 0306		503.464.3740 (fax)
Portland, OR 97204		todd.perry@enron.comCommenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chie=
f Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that =
"you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  Below is a C=
liff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 =
PM today.  Attached is the complete work. =20

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "While the amount of=
 such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, th=
ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi=
on dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?At the same time, while there are vast su=
ms due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller=
s by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California. =
 Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller=
?  The Chief Judge thinks not."  Another notable quote:  "?it is the opinio=
n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has=
 not and cannot be substantiated." =20

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa=
s summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=
 offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also =
rejected.=20
 =20
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales =
in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recomme=
ndations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales that a=
re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de=
livery."=20

Evidentiary Hearing- "The differences between what the State of California =
believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what =
the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater=
ial issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds =
involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty=
pe, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to =
the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer =
to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule=
.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot=
ential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be =
appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an =
after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the m=
ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede=
d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund =
period."

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=
he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order =
to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS=
O's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O=
ctober 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001. =20

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso=
ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) pro=
vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based =
upon a daily spot gas price.  "In the event that the marginal unit is locat=
ed in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate a=
nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the =
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If =
the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas=
 price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t=
he marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  =
The daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Fina=
ncial Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned deliver=
y points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the =
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and hol=
idays)."=20

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the cal=
culated market clearing price. =20

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma=
rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s=
ubtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin=
g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E =
and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=
 prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea=
l-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the =
same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge r=
ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat=
ing refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergen=
cy requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual p=
rices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated=
.

Offsets-  "Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref=
und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char=
ges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts=
 due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset a=
gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their=
 purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period."

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless=
 the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

Just a reminder:

		YOUR TIME ENTRY IS DUE TODAY.

 Just to keep you up-to-date on the progress we've made with your system access - After a few failed attempts to "clone" Ryan Slinger's account and copy it over to your user ID, I've gone ahead and requested all the applications and drives you'll need through the IT website. I believe Bill also requested a few things, so you should be set. 

When you work next, will you please check your access to Enpower (Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, Reports - CARP, SAR, Real Time Position Manager) as well as the m:drive (El Paso Model)? I've received e-mails back from my IT requests saying they've been granted, so if you are still denied access, we'll have to pursue a different line of questioning.

Please e-mail me with your results Thursday night.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject:	Access for new Real Time trader: John Anderson

Has there been any progress on creating a profile for our new trader, John Anderson? I know you had copied Ryan Slinger's profile over to get him access to all the necessary applications, but I just heard from Bill that as of this morning John (aka Casey) was still unable to access Enpower and the M:drive. Could you let me know when you get a moment today how this is going? 

Thanks,
KateThe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.

Geographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.

Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.

Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.

Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  

Price Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:

	1.	Gas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.
	2.	O&M increases from $2 to $6.
	3.	Fuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).
	4.	Similarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. 

A reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).

Demand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. 

ISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. 

Comments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.

Settlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

Bill - just wanted to let you know I was thinking of you today.  It was a long time ago when returnig from a shakedown patrol in the caribbean Dave Staton came down to the engine room lower level when my submarine pulled into New London telling me to get topside and to the hospital as my wife was having a baby. 
 
I missed you being born by about 1/2 hour.  But I was able to get there and hold you soon after.  You looked like Winston Churchill (with a little turtle head).
 
Your Mom was exhausted but happy.  Mke sure you give her a call today.  I know she misses talking to you.
 
Love 
 
DadThis was Elsie's response to my question about "DPR rate actualization" charges on the Real Time PMA	. Looks like Virginia added a transmission deal to account for October 2000 BPA transmission. Virginia, could you tell me why BPA transmission charges were not assessed in October? Was this the invalid contract Elsie refers to in her e-mail? Let me know if you have any further information.

Thanks,
Kate

The bulk ($1,527.67) of the amount pertains to deal 589786.1.  In the comment section of this deal, it states that on 4/23 "an annuity was added to true up BPA tranny purchases......see VT for billing detail."  On the billing, there is a footnote in which the losses is calculated by :

	Intertie Service = x kwh * .030

	Northwest Service = x kwh * .019

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you,
Elsie

PS- the reason this is being pulled in now is that there was a problem w/ loading the deal to Unify due to an invalid contract.

Elsie -

I have a question regarding our desk's PMA report for July. We've incurred three charges under the heading "DPR rate actualization." Virginia Thompson in Volume Management has informed me that these have to do with BPA transmission reservations; however, I was wondering if you might be able to further clarify this charge for me (your initials appear next to the individual explanations) or point to someone who can. I assume the charges, which total $1,819 (including a credit for $100) have something to do with line loss payback. But I'd like to know how this is calculated.

Please let me know if you can assist.

Thank you,
Kate Symes

After the Day ahead market ran, the branch group PDCI (TNOB) TTC in the
(N-S) direction was changed from 2875 MW to 1956 MW for HE's 0700 through
1200 for operating day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is the Celilo
Converter #1 DC harmonic filters is out of service.  The first applicable
Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE 0000.  The ISO will update
you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations,
inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.  
To whom it may concern:

It's come to my attention that the SRP OASIS user ID which was being used by Enron's West Hourly trading team has been disabled. Holden Salisbury, one of our cash traders, spoke with someone in your office about setting up a new ID for the Real Time group. Enron Power Marketing, Inc. already has company-wide access to the site; but the Real Time group regularly reserves transmission on this OASIS site and needs a login name and password of its own.

Could you please let me know what information I need to provide to get this set up? I would greatly appreciate your help in issuing a new Real Time password as soon as possible, or in directing me to a more appropriate contact.

"Verdana" and set it to bold.  This is clearly the most effective and
authoritative font.  I can see that you already use bold as default, which
is good, but you need to step up to the next level.

The two dispatcher log entries show that Enron requested operating reserves
for the same contingency the occurred about 16:18 on June 30th.  They
continued to request reserves for several subsequent hours for the same
contingency. Note also, that MCC was called about the first contingency at
14:52 but no request for reserves was made.  

In listening to the voice recorder:
1.	Mark called at 16:28 and said he had been calling "Casey" at Munro
all day with reliability problem reports and requesting operating reserves.
Finally, he was directed to call the Dittmer generation dispatcher.  Mark
said he had fuel problems and needed reserves.  He also wanted to know who
to call for reporting hourly actual generation because we told him that the
hourly reporting had stopped at 0400.  Seems they were calling Munro with
this information also.
2.	 Burt called at 17:32 and asked for more operating reserves for the
same 16:18 contingency of fuel problems.  We said no.  They are allowed to
use operating reserves only through HE17 due the time of the event being
16:18.  They must call the TBL real-time scheduler and change transmission
schedules.  
Bernie (BPA) then called our RT schedulers to convey the previous events.
RT schedulers told Bernie that the Enron schedulers hung up on them and did
not change any of the transmission schedules when the RT schedulers refused
to provide any more operating reserves.Thresa and Amy -

I'd be more than happy to maintain a database of El Paso discrepancies for Settlements to access on a daily basis; however, I'd like to get a little more clarity on exactly what the goal is with this reconciliation model. My impression is that it compares volumes and price in the El Paso model with volumes and price in Enpower. Here's what we currently do: The traders reconcile the model to Enpower each night, then write the variances on a hard copy of the CARP report. Kathy calls me if there are any differences between the model and actuals in the morning. Therefore, you won't see discrepancies in physical flow in this reconciliation model. Again, I want to make sure we're all getting what we need out of this model. 

Please let me know how to proceed.

I was previously unaware of the reconciliation model you guys used last month to true up Enpower and El Paso deals. This month I've been checking out with Kathy every day or so - mostly small adjustments to the model - so a compilation of discrepancies hasn't been necessary for my purposes.

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

JMFDavid - you too must change your e mail list for Bill Williams.  Please send this to bill.williams.III@enron.com.  Not bill.williams@enron.com.  Subtle difference.  But if you consider your information worthy of review - please make the e-mail change.

There will be no substantial heat in California  this week. In fact, temperatures wil actually average below normal for  Monday-Wednesday before warming at the end of the week. Although there is some  possibility of above to much above normal temperatures in California and the  Desert Southwest, it seems more likely that at least a partial start to the  monsoon thunderstorms will occur. Since the normal high is 104 in Phoenix, I  would opt for 1-2 degrees above normal as an average for the week. 
 
The Pacific Northwest will see below normal  temperatures for the next 10-14 days on average. 
Above normal precipitation for the time of  year...

I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th.  ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy.  That price is $23 per mw.  Please revise the annuity as appropriate.

If you remember when we met with him this Spring, he mentioned that Idaho Power had the right to demand energy and or wheel through MPC's system that could cause them to be out-of-balance up to 25% of the time.  Starting yesterday Idaho initiated this process.  Mike has requested Idaho express their intentions on a preschedule basis where he in turn will notify you.  Today (6/22) and throughout the weekend MPC plans to be in a deficit position.  You might want to contact Mike (406) 497-4575 to work out a pre-notification process so as to help to identify "trends" so that our Real-Time group will be able to better anticipate MPC's needs.

Subject:	New Enpower Issue

I have one more thing to add to the list of Enpower requests:

Deals done under the EPMI Short Term West Hourly desk do not need to be confirmed. The Real Time traders know they need to check "No" in the Confirmation box in Deal Entry; however, it's one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked. It occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of Real Time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed - and unnecessarily confusing counterparties - if we could make "No confirmation" an automatic default for all deals entered under the Short Term West Hourly book. 

I can't think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change, but let's discuss that during the next Enpower meeting. Please let me know what we can do to get this implemented.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of "PWX Tag 123"  show "123 (PWX TAG)?" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

Let's try something a little bit different regarding Real Time deal disputes....

When Virginia and Mike receive a dispute from Houston, they'll file the pertinent information in a drawer (marked DMS) to the right of my desk, in a folder with your name on it. Please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many. Sometime over the course of your shift, take a minute to address the discrepancy, make strides to resolve it. If it happens to be more complicated than an "intra-shift fix," talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution (pull tapes, pull our hair out, etc.)

The most important step of this new procedure is post-op - TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. Sign the corresponding DMS sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back. Return it to Virginia, Mike, or me. Whatever you do, don't leave without a trace.

I'd like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan; so feedback is welcome. In the meantime, this procedure will be effective immediately. Some of you already have disputes in your files.....Enjoy.

  MPC looked again and does not show this deal.  Most of the Houston Coordinators have responded and they have no discrepancies (purchase or sale) on March 14th.  There are 2 who I'm awaiting responses from still.  
  
  I'll let you know if I find either side.  Right now, I'm inclined to think the INC sheet is wrong and there was no deal at that hour.  Can you or Kate check with the trader who 'booked' the deal at HE 3 and let him search his notes and explain why the MW volumes and prices changed that HE in the INC sheet when there is no further documentation.....

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve these problems.

970-240-6206Dear Traders and Schedulers:

  The following information is FYI.  Diana Scholtes may have given you this information already, but I just spoke with Corrine at BPA and I think that we can lessen our exposure to hefty charges with the following information:

  Please be advised that BPA carries an "Unauthorized Increase" charge for the use of transmission that is not properly reserved.  That charge is $12,000.00 PER MW.
When calling in for transmission, especially Real-Time, please be careful when using our account numbers, OASIS numbers, and contract numbers.  I suggest that when you use the account number, that you review the structure of the product in that account with the BPA tranny person. (ie- confirm that you are requesting hourly non-firm on the DC Intertie S/N if that is what you intend to reserve.)  

  Thus far, we have avoided these $12,000.00 charges by splitting some other costs with BPA.  Let's just be careful in the future so that we don't get hit big.

  Please let me know if you have any questions.

  Thanks,

  VirginiaGroup, Here's the plan for Sunday/Monday:

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called.  This is due to the ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes.  We don't want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

So, please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade.  Below is their preschedule, mw's available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID's.  Also, attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone #'s.  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.

 I've added a few comments to the objectives section. I'm in general agreement with the bulk of the comments, i.e. good standards of excellence, sharp guy. My one subtle, but real criticism deals with attitude and cheekiness, particularly with respect to senior level folks, in that J probably needs two or three tablesponns of humility, a comment that I've heard from a number of people.

 << File: BRYSON JESSE.doc >> Due to problems with a Mirant downstream, I had to change a couple of paths late Monday.  The new and improved paths are:

LADWP-CISO(T)LDWP/SYL GF-LDWP(T)SYL/MALIN #LDWP00000178F-LA(T)SYL/MALIN LDWPCA0024-LADWP-MORGAN-BPA(T)MALIN/JD #10031F-BPA(T)JD/PGE #10031NF-MORGAN-AEP-EPMI-CAES-PGE.  Deal numbers 630912 and 556517.

IPCO-IPCO(T)IPCO/LGBP #79606F-IPCO-EPMI-MIRANT-SNOH-BPA(T)LGBP/JD #96092NF-SNOH-MIRANT-BPA(T)JD/MALIN #371697F-CISO(T)MALIN/NP15-MIRANT.  Deal numbers 524174 and 626428.

Both for 25mw on Light-load for 06/05.  I have made a tag, #24026, for the LA to PGE path.  It was made as a preschedule tag, but due to the lateness of it, BPA may deny it just because they can.  If that happens, EPMI real-time will have to make a real-time tag.  You can use my tag as a template.  Late breaking news - my tag went undelivered due to communication failure at PGE, so I faxed the tag to all the counterparties.  Mirant has made tag #5673 for the IPCO to NP15 path.  

All counterparties have been called as of 15:30 and are aware that these schedules are going real-time - that is, their real time groups will call the schedules in to BPA.  EPMI real-time will have to make sure this gets done with a reminder phone call to our counterparties.

I have spoken with PGE/Donna, AEP/Peggy, Mirant/Emily, and IPCO/Perry.  CAES (Conagra) had already gone home for the day and has no real-time.

Any questions?  Please call.

Thanks, Donald Robinson.This is the 37 MW generator in Montana that Enron has some ownership interest in. They are due to come up off maintenance around June 22 and will have the power available for us to market through the end of June (before their next QF year starts). I have agreed with Terry Donovan that we would charge $5.00/Mwh as a services fee and recover all wheeling costs. We can sell this power to third parties or to internal Enron books. There will be wheeling in on MT system unless we can talk with Dianna about serving MT load with it. It is unit contingent.

I've added a fee to 2 deals Bert did with Bloomberg on 7/31 - 711929 and 711931. Total impact you should see in the DPR - $105 ($15 flat fee per 7 trades). 

Let me know if you run into any problems with this.

Thanks,
KateVirgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Subject:	PMA's

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

EPMI will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).

Here is a note of things to remember:

?	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.  The plant will call with updates periodically.  Please record this information in the dispatch log.  This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.  Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log.

?	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.  That's 353MW @ $5.  Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.

?	Our telephone line (403-974-6900) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours.  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line.

?	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403.  

?	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.  This most likely won't happen.  In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.  You must Login (top right hand corner) as John A. Zufferli.  Click on ETS, then Submission.  You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required.

?	If you have any problems you can reach Bill Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at  billgreenizan@epagenet.net.

Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

"Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week."

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line. 

Jon

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

Jon Gail, Manager

The Commission rejected requests by the ISO, California Electricity Oversight Board (CEOB) and the California PUC to weaken the creditworthiness provisions as they apply to DWR, PG&E and SCE.  The order is attached. The FERC also denied the Attorney General's motion to intervene -- this is important because only intervenors can appeal the decision to the courts.

Our flashed amount for April should be different from your flashed amount, but this variance never come through desk analysis afterwards.  Would you please advise why it's not being picked up by Settlements?

Lisa - 
I'm trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at Kyrene for the 31st of May didn't make it into the preschedule sheet. I'm looking for the following deals:

627022 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH - 2 MW @ $0
	 comments: Losses at Kyrene

627025 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV
	 HLH - 76 MW @ $170
	 comments: Delivery at Kyrene

These deals are pulling into the CARP report, but are not shown in either the preschedule or Real Time El Paso models. Therefore, Enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model. Can you give me a hint on this one?

Thanks,
KateI had to make one more change to the sept. schedule.  It only effects bert, linder, merriss and anderson.  Please check it soon

Intel:
Saturday through Tuesday HE1-24 we are sending 4mw to puget system for a services deal to Intel.  This deal has started 9/01/01.  They will preschedule it on Tuesday to start Wednesday.  Until then we are filling it real time.  You need to get 4mw to puget system HE1-24 Saturday through Tuesday.  You need to call puget dispatch(not RT) and let them know where it's coming from:(425)882-4630.  And you need to tag it each and every hour***.  If you have any problems you need to call Chris Foster immediatly(any hour).  This is a big deal and we need it to go smoothly while real time has it for the first four days.  Any questions call Chris.  It goes in the ink sheet as a sale to intel at $34.60.  There is a sale enpowered through Tuesday: #759607(link your purchase and transmission to this deal).

***On the tag in the comment section puget dispatch wants to see MPC(If montana is generating)/BPA/PSE/INTEL.  They are saving the tags as a record of the deal and this helps them differentiate the tag from other real time deals.  

I filled this HE 1-4 with Frontier which came up last night.  Frontier tripped at 3:05 I got the call at 3:30 and it was a real headache to get the contingency reserves put in for HE4 and a new purchase for HE5.  If you fill this with Frontier you're asking for trouble.  Use the montana if you can.

If you fill it with Montana we have a BPA transmission account from Hot Springs to Puget #844794thanks alan

Subject: Documenting CAISO's purchases from CERS/DWR


It may be easier to document than I thought.

Anjali Sheffrin's July report shows data for June (p. 5).  The majority
of real time purchases are from CERS/DWR and the price for OOM is
substantially higher than other R/T power.  The need for OOM greatly
diminished begining in late May, yet CAISO bought most of its R/T power
from CERS/DWR.

We are disappointed to announce that Philippe Bibi, president and CEO of Enron Net Works, has resigned from Enron. Philippe will be joining Putnam Investments in Boston, Mass. as Chief Technology Officer.

Philippe joined Enron in 1995, as Chief Information Officer for Enron Capital & Trading, and has been a key member of the team that built Enron's IT organization, including our numerous successful e-commerce initiatives.  Philippe has been a great asset to Enron and our IT efforts.

For six years, his creativity, intelligence, and focus have benefited the company in many ways.  He will be missed.

Philippe has agreed to make himself available to assist in the transition of his responsibilities.  In the interim, all of the employees who report to Philippe will continue reporting to the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works. 

Please join us in thanking Philippe for his  many years of service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

Due to problems earlier today with the CAISO's outbound e-mail, this is a
duplicate of a message sent this morning.  Please disregard this notice if
you have already received it.
ISO Market Participants:
In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") June 19 order, the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ("ISO") was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions.  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all in-state load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs.  In compliance, the ISO filed, on July 10, 2001, proposed Tariff
revisions to develop:
1.	a rate for the emission allowance charge, 
2.	an escrow account for monies collected; 
3.	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees; and 
4.	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs.  
In a Market Notice posted on August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate.  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html> .
The June 19 FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude start-up fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price, and instead, to
pay generators for such start-up fuel costs, in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees.  In a Market Notice posted on
August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial start-up fuel charge rate.
The ISO has modified the previously posted start-up fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this
rate.  This information is also posted at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html

> Virginia & Mike -

In your (sadly noted) absence today, I decided to put together a brief document to help facilitate the dispute research process and its relation to the Real Time group. I know this is information of which you're well aware, but I thought it would be useful to have it documented for our convenience as well as for future generations of Volume Management experts.

Please let me know what you think - if all relevant information is included and whether or not it's conveyed clearly. 

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: FW: Question


My response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in.  If they have a bid
in, they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to FERC.  Right?
Who do they send cost justification to?

Keoni:

In addition to my questions below, can you clarify what we get paid when
we are inc'd pursuant to the FERC Order?  Is the proxy the inc? If we do
not have a bid in, do we get the inc?  If we have a supplemental bid in,
do we get the higher of the inc or the bid?   If we do get the higher
of, to whom do we send our cost data?

I agree with Bill's assessment as shown in the attachment.  Prior to submitting bids, Vol Mgmt needs to know the agreed upon shared savings between EPMI and the specific customers so we can set up our tools to capture these correctly.  Please stop by to discuss.

Thanks,

Kourtney

Subject:	Decremental Bidding

Chris,

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

 Guys,

Arco has an extra 6mw, HE1-24, SP15, for us to sell on Wednesday, 8/1.  Please sell for the best price possible, they have to run.  I would say take $8-10 (each hour) for your troubles.

Thanks a bunch,
Stan

Here's a little write up as to what is happening tomorrow night.

Our Suite will be open early.  It is Suite No. 7.  (located on the right field side of home plate on level 1 of the skyboxes).

I'd suggest the light rail vs. trying to park downtown.  They ticket cars parked on the street and have them towed if you are not is a designed PGE Parking site.

So - I'm expecting the coach of the Timbers to visit us after the match.

This is an adult event - beverages of the over 21 crowd will be available:

The Portland Timbers announced today the promotional lineup for the upcoming matches at PGE Park, including the Vancouver Whitecaps on June 29th and the San Diego Flash F.C. on July 3rd.
On June 29th, the Portland Rain will play the Seattle Lady Saints in a pre-game exhibition match that will kick-off at 4:15pm, before the Timbers take on the Vancouver Whitecaps in a key A-League Western Conference showdown at 7:05 p.m. 
The Portland Rain women's soccer team is a provisional member of the United Soccer Leagues (USL) W-1 Women's League. Last year, the Rain competed in the Pacific Coast Soccer League's women's division and were undefeated during the regular season, but lost in the 2000 McAdam Cup Tournament. The Saints are the current Region 4 National Cup Champions. 
Also, International Night will take place on Friday, June 29th, featuring The Lions of Batucada, a marching percussion ensemble based in Portland that features African-influenced dance music of Brazil. Founded in 1996 by Brian Davis, Derek Roth and Andrew Hartzell, the group continues to gain members. Over 40 drummers and dancers will entertain Timbers fans at PGE Park. The Lions of Batucada performed in the Grand Floral Parade for the Portland Rose Festival, and in 1998 they won the Rose Festival Association Staff Favorite Award for the Starlight Parade. 

Mike -

You should now have access to Enpower (Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, Position Manager) and the West Power Fundamentals website; and you should have access to the Lotus Notes discussion database by early next week. Please let me know if you have any trouble using these applications or getting into the computer drives you need.

The Internal Communications department has not yet released the original video. I don't have an ETA at this time.

I would like to have a feel for how many people are still interested in viewing this meeting. Please send me an email if you are interested in viewing the replay of the All Employee Meeting. I will then communicate with those who are interested. DO NOT select reply to all as it will go to all Calgary and Portland employees.

Subject:	Viewing of All Employee Meeting

All,


The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Dan Dietrich

  I wanted to let you all know that I have added some replacement deals to the ST CA and ST W Hourly books that we spoke about yesterday.  Below is an explanation of why, and I have listed the old deals and the replacement deals......	

ST W Services sold a position to the ST CA book and ST ST W Hrly desks, but the energy didn't flow due to a scheduled outage.  Since the energy didn't flow, the desks entered some sales to WHEELABRATOR to sell back the energy that didn't flow.  This sale should have been to the ST W Services book to sell back the position, not to WHEELABRATOR.  I zero'd out the sales to WHEELABRATOR and entered intra-desk annuities.  Please see below:

Sunday 6-17-01 

 RT old deal : 650578.1
RT new deal: PA 679980 SA 679973

ST CA old deal: 650607.1

I guess it's a comment on our times when the height of a person's morality
is being choosy about whom they steal from.
		-tycho, penny-arcade, Sept, 2001URGENT

    WASHINGTON (AP)   Federal regulators voted Monday to order price
restraints on electricity sales across the West but not the
stringent cost-based controls sought by California.
    The 5-0 vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
followed intense pressure not only from California Gov. Gray Davis
and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House
Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could
affect the 2002 election.
    FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order, effective through
September 2002, will benefit consumers but also will ``provide
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs.''
    The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April
on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand
periods when blackouts were threatened.

I'm still attempting to get our three new traders set up with the necessary Lotus Notes databases. I just tried to login as Darin Presto, and it appears he does not yet have an ID. Could you let me know what more I need to do to get these guys access to the following Lotus Notes databases?

Thanks,

Lisa -

Thanks for looking into this, and for your quick response. I'm not sure which databases you're looking at (possibly East Real Time?), but I've attached a list of the four databases the new Portland Real Time traders need access to. The traders names are: Darin Presto; John C. Anderson; Michael Mier. Of course, their need for a Lotus Notes account is implicit in this request. Beyond that, they need the following:

Title - WSCC Outages
Server - ECTPDX-LN1/ECT
Filename - mail\wsccnet.nsf

Title - West Realtime
Server - ECTPDX-LN1/ECT
Filename - mail\WestReal.nsf

Title - West Power Scheduling Archive
Server - ECTHOU_LN1/ECT
Filename - Power\powrschdiarchive.nsf

Title - West Power Scheduling Discussion
Server - ECTHOU_LN1/ECT
Filename - Power\powrschdi.nsf

Again, thank you for your help with this, and please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Thanks,
Kate

There are two databases which I cannot locate:

West Realtime
WSCC Outages


However, I did locate:

Real Time Operations:  ECTPDX-LN1/ECT\realtime\myaccoun.nsf (Would this be the correct database?)
Realtime:  ECTHOU-LN7/ECT\mail\realtime.nsf


For WSCC Outages and West Realtime databases, if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following:

Close the database icon
Right-click on the database icon
Choose File, Database, Properties
Then send me the Title, Server, and Filename information.  This will be of great help.


Many Thanks and Please Advise.

Thanks,

BobGood point Bill.  Now that we are sure what happened to #549162.1 is correct, I am following up with Settlements group in Houston regarding the other side of the deal, i.e. #549160.  Somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them, but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty.

Fran,
If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Group,

This evening, Friday, 6/1, you will need to call the ISO real-time desk to have them change Harbor Cogen's Pmax.  This morning, we had them change it from 80mw to 85mw through HE22.  We did this because we made a sale through HE22 with the assumption that their Pmax was 85mw, when in fact, the ISO had it at 80mw.

So, please call the ISO real-time desk this evening to have them change Harbor's Pmax from 85mw back to 80mw.

Thanks,
Stan

Green Room,

Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present
an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the
move to D1.  I think better competition will be more fun, provided that
we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent
basis.  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the
Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with
a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker
and better than myself.  So for what it's worth.  D1 all the way.

Thanks.

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

Billy,

I just wanted to thank you for your making the time to meet with me on Tuesday afternoon.  I appreciated your time and felt it gave me some useful information regarding the analyst program.  I believe the better understanding of the program that you provided will allow me to better manage and coordinate the activities of the analysts in the real-time group in Portland.  I do think a visit and information session later in the summer might be helpful as well.

Thank you again for your time and enjoy the holiday weekend.

Bill Hey what's up?  You playing soccer tonight?
Looks like I pretty much "chickened-out" today. It might take me a few days to work up my courage. He doesn't plan to review us (there are only 3 of us) until next week. Can you believe that?

	Here's the information Tim mentioned in yesterday's meeting.  Follow directions listed below if you are interested in participating in the Pilot.

Want to develop your professional skills & knowledge?
Want to enhance your ability to add value to Enron?
Want to be among the first 100 people to move Enron towards Digital Learning?
Want a chance to win two roundtrip airline tickets?

We are piloting Building Business Acumen (BBA), eLearning performance simulations.  You will experience case analysis, ever changing scenarios, and problem solving with personalized feedback, based on your choices and actions.  The BBA will provide you with learning material in:
Creating Competitive Advantage
Evaluating Market Opportunities
Maximizing Operational Performance
(to read more, open attached file)

Modules
Modules are designed to help managers and other decision-makers to build essential business skills and  enhance the strategic perspective of any member of the enterprise. Learners are challenged to achieve specific real-world business objectives and master the fundamentals of general business skills. 

Business Leaders
Professors from Babson College, a leader in Executive Development & Entrepreneurship, provided materials and content for the courses.  Babson College is ranked #1 in entrepreneurship by Business Week, Financial Times, Success magazine and U.S. News & World Report.  

Course Delivery
You can take the course in segments of time that are conducive to your daily schedule - if you want to work on it for 5 minutes or 5 hours, it will bookmark the place when you last left.  Each module is approximately 8 hours in length and can be accessed from any computer with Internet access.  

Your Involvement
If you chose to participate in this pilot, you are agreeing to complete one of the aforementioned modules and provide feedback based on your experience.  The pilot will begin in mid-September and will conclude in mid-October.  

How do I WIN?
In order to be qualified for the Airplane tickets, you must complete one module and provide feedback.  The completed evaluation will enter you in the drawing.  If you complete more than one module you will be entered multiple times.  You'll have a great chance to win the tickets because less than 100 people will participate in this pilot.

PaulCara,

First of all, thanks for your input.  

Regarding the new issues with path confirmation, most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily.  Vish is already working on them.  
Concerning the colors, there are three sets of colors representing market, supply and transmission.  I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking.  This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application.

Regarding Pre-Schedule, adding print capability to the error log should be no problem.  Also, adding "check for errors" functionality will be done.  
Concerning "Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"; I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips (either term or schedule) for a deal, but the strips have different delivery points.  The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use.  I will confirm this.

We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name.  I may have both the code and description displayed.  I believe Corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records (Corry, can you confirm this?).

The information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days, but if you have more, please send it.

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> 


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, "Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower "short name" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

Hello, were very excited that you have decided to except our invitation!!
Due to the large traffic of companies that week because of the business
career fair, we will be having two speakers at the meeting on September 26
(your company and Enterprise).  Since Enterprise accepted first we will have
them present first.

We were thinking that we would a lot you both up to 45 minutes.  It doesn't
have to be that long though.  Feel free to present whatever you would like.
Some examples of what you could talk about... your companies history,
positions recruiting for, what your looking for in a candidate, what a makes
a resume stand out, a questions and answer section, etc.

Feel free to bring treats, or little company toys like the ones handed out
at job fairs.  I think Enterprise was thinking about bringing pizza.

Feel free to contact me with any other questions.  I will get in touch with
you when the date gets closer to finalize everything.

Sincerely,
Colleen Gibson

Dear Grace,

I hope your summer is giving you some opportunities to enjoy nice weather.

We've had an interesting inquiry from a national business publication;
they're looking for stories about people who've been through our negotiation
courses who feel the course played a significant role in their professional
-- or personal lives.

Can you think of anyone from Enron/Portland who might be interested in being
interviewed?

Please give my regards to the 'gang'.  I look forward to working with you
again.

Cordially,

This information was sent by Tim Belden and Chris Calger earlier in the year. I am sending it again for the benefit of our new hires and as a reminder to be responsible while enjoying this evening's event.

============

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

============

PLEASE NOTE: We now have cab vouchers available for our company events. Please check with your admin assistant to obtain a voucher, or see me at the event--no questions asked.

Thanks,
Grace

Howdy all!

Just an FYI: If you are interested in applying your Derivatives Course(s) to a particular certification as CPE hours AND have completed Derivatives I and/or II, please let me know. I will arrange to have a CPE certificate sent to the office in your name.

Thanks,
Grace

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

		Construction and operation of steam, hydro and gas turbine
	Transmission and Overhead Distribution Systems
		Power and distribution transformers
	Wye and Delta overhead distribution systems
	Power and energy calculations
	Adjourn

Dates:		Wednesday, November 14th & Thursday, November 15th (2-day course--attendance required both days)
Time:		8:00am - 5:00pm
Location:		2WTC Oregon Room
What to bring:	Pen (or pencil) and paper
Other items:	Course materials provided at start of class
			Breakfast and Lunch will be provided both days

Course Description
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting & Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge & Applications 12.

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options
Incorporate volatility term structures, "smiles and skews", in analyzing deals
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. "blend-and-extend"Read about the two new FERC Commissioners.

It's all in the latest eBiz.  Go to home.enron.com, click Publications, then click eBiz and "eBiz April 13, 2001."To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.

We have 10 MW of length from Sierra through the APX light load at $185.  Stan purchased this NP15 length from the APX and it should be scheduled DA by Jeremy.  There should be a ECTRT load zone in PGE3 with this length.  Use whatever opportunities are out there (dynegy across COB or a straight export) to maximize this position.  The deal numbers are: 581335-purchase from APX and 581356-desk to desk deal.  Please make sure this gets taken care of.

Cheers

Bill,

EPE length is in Enpower, deal# 577883, this will be out in RT Position Manager.  56mws for the day.
The schedule is as follows:

HE 1	8 mws
HE2	8 mws
HE3	8 mws
HE4	8mws
HE5	8mws
HE6	10mws
HE24	6mws

TOTAL 	= 56mws

Please sell this power real time.Hey Bill,

I swapped days with Leaf and would like to attend the "Tricks of the Trade for Energy Analysts" class on April 18th.  Please enroll me.

Thanks,

David.Deal number on the buy from PNM is #581199.

The shape of this length is:

HE1	50
HE2	50
HE3	50
HE4	50
HE5	45
HE6	20
HE23	35
HE24	50

Day total is 350.

ThanksBill, I have reservations for four at Morton's on Saturday night at 9:00pm.  Let me know if you want to go, if not we will just go by ourselves.

My cell phone number is 503-807-5669.
Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as "EPMI_CISO_**" and the Export as "CISO_EPMI_**," the ISO views these as unique imports and exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing ancillary services charges to occur.  

Thank you!As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.


Enjoy,

SlingerHey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

Account numbers:
SPP - PAC: 853724
SPP-SNOHO: 853703
SPP-PUGET: 853725


GeirHey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

Application SupportBill,

EPMI made $90,741.17 marketing fees from Grays Paper for March. Have you done the 75/25 split annuity yet?

LesHey Guys. 

We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm. 

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO. 


Procedure:
Export at Cascade from the CISO. 
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System. 

Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.

I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.

Geir

you are long at np, because i did not put a imbalance deal in.  I figured you were going to sell that 10 mws of np length off to a sc on a realtime basis.  So, please take care of thisThe Mt. Hood conference room is reserved for us at 9:30 tomorrow for our meeting.
Thanks,
JesseHi Bill!

Thank you for returning the paperwork to me. They are installing hardwoods
on 4th floor right now. (I was down there this am). The Lobby is
complete...just some touch up needed. Elevator is up & running.

At this time, we need you to identify a Lender and get yourself pre-approved
and have the Lender pre-approve the project. Because it is a conversion,
some Lenders have trouble doing the loan. Jerry Wilson of Pacific Northwest
Mortgage, Inc. has pre-approved this project and is doing a number of other
loans at the Roosevelt.
In case you'd like his number it is: 503-224-4564 or pager 503-224-4308
(Tell him you are calling re: Roosevelt).

Let me know which Lender you are working with and I will give them the
necessary info about the building.

Bill, 
Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.
I have missed you my friend, take care,
Sara

Hey there Bill!

I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)

Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki

Subject:	Commission Agenda- Market Monitoring and Mitigation   

FYI, Docket No. EL00-95-12 (market monitoring and mitigation) appears on the Commission's agenda for next Wednesday, as agenda item CAE-42.



<Embedded StdOleLink>Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, company-sponsored outings to Edgefield, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties.  While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events.  I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy Fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer, and wine.  You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time.  If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assisance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked.  The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Congressional Republicans Draft Energy Bill to Aid the West=09
Rep. Joe Barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding =
energy markets in the Western United States via funding for improvements in=
 California's constrained transmission line SP-15 and directing federal dis=
aster officials to prepare for power outages.  The move by Republicans came=
 as Democratic criticism of the Bush administration's response to the Calif=
ornia power crisis intensified Wednesday.  Although the bill will not conta=
in the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans, Barton =
said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committe=
e deliberations.  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a=
 range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor=
's request; increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; f=
iring up mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduc=
e energy use by 10%.  Additionally, the bill would grant governors the flex=
ibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to tempor=
arily keep operating during emergencies.=09
All of us are aware of the energy crisis confronting us, and the situation might get a lot worse this summer.  PGE has taken actions to reduce energy consumption, e.g., decreasing the amount of lighting within the building.  

In the spirit of energy conservation, Chris Calger and I are asking that you turn off your monitor(s) each day.  You do not need to log out of your computers to do this--simply press the monitor off button.  If you have any questions about how to turn off your monitor(s), check with Dave Steiner in our IT Department.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Subject: Californians for Renewable Energy, Inc. (CARE)  v. BC Hydro,	et al., EL01-65
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="=_5D06B43C.1A7B1DE3"

FYI - Attached is a complaint filed by CARE on April 16 against BC Hydro, Powerex, Mirant and BPA (with the LADWP thrown in as an unnamed respondent).  The complaint is principally directed against BC Hydro and Powerex.  It essentially accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in BC and transmission capacity reserved by Powerex on the BPA system to COB and NOB to withhold power during a period of peak demand "to contrive a shortage and test their market power."  CARE accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of violating Section 206 of the FPA, state and federal anti-trust laws, the civil rights of Californians under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and NAFTA.

The complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts.  The evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the YAHOO Message Board by an unnamed power trader in Spokane (we think it is an Avista trader), selected transmission data from the ISO, the LA Times article of April 11, 2001 regarding the ISO's report on Powerex, BPA and LADWP, the ISO report itself, and BC Hydro's residential rate schedule.  CARE requests FERC to initiate an investigation, seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want FERC to have the Secretary of DOE declare an emergency under Section 202(c) of the FPA and compel deliveries of electricity.

FERC has noticed the complaint and has established May 8 as the due date for interventions and responses.

You will get stopped out.  I talked to David Port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var.  However, until its fixed I have no choice but to use the reported numbers.

Subject:	West VAR

the numbers being generated for the west's var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be.  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations.  for example, the ltnw book has a grant total of <3,000> MWh from now through September On-Peak and 194,000 MWh from now through September Off-Peak.  the var report shows mike with $20 million of var -- about $16 million of it coming between now and september.  we have a total var of $30 million, with about $20 million between now and september.  by my rough calculations, we would have to have the entire curve move roughly $100/MWh in one day for this var to be accurate.  that means that once every 20 days the entire summer curve -- peak and off-peak -- would have to move in excess of $100/MWh.  i might add that we are short q4 which i'm not giving us any credit for as an offset. 

i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books.  i just don't think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out.  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery.  we see the same thing with option valuations.  we see option model valuations (e.g., transmission spread options) going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality.  similarly, the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches.

bottom line.  i need to know what you want us to do.  we are chewing up a lot of var.  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now.  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn't necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the "model" happy.
I will be taking Tuesday and Friday of this week off.  I will be at home and available by cell phone.  If needed, I will be able to come into the office for a short period of time.for your reading pleasure.

Subject:	Daily EOL/ICE Summary 4/24


I am trying to put together a reference sheet for important power trading numbers and conversions.  This will be used as part of a training course put on by Jon Koomy.  For example:
8760 hours per year.
On Peak hours are roughly 56% per year and off peak hours are roughly 44% per year.
One natural gas futures contract contains 10,000 MMBtu's



Please help me with this exercise.  Think about what number you use everyday and write them down for me by the end of Monday.
